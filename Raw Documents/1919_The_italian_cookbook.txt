SPAGHETTI, MACARONI ETC. 
 (Pasta Asciutta) 
  
 The Italians serve the spaghetti or macaroni 
 at the beginning of the meal, in place of soup, and 
 they give it the name of Minestra Asdutta or 
 "dry" soup. Besides the familiar spaghetti, the 
 paste is served in many other forms and with 
 different seasoning. This is by far the most 
 popular Italian dish, and it seems to have pleased the taste of all the peoples of the earth. 
 The highly nutritive qualities of spaghetti and of 
 cheese, their indispensable condiment, have been 
 recognized by all diet authorities and, as for its 
 palatableness, the lovers of spaghetti are just as 
 enthusiastic and numerous outside of Italy as 
 within the boundaries of that blessed country. 
 The most popular seasoning for spaghetti, are 
 tomato sauce, brown stock and anchovy sauce. 
 The description of these three condiments follows:

 MEAT STUFPING FOR VOL-AU-VENT 
 (Ripieno di came per pasticcini di pasta sfoglia) 
  
 This stuffing can be made either with stewed 
 veal or chicken giblets or sweetbreads. The 
 latter are preferable, being more delicate and a 
 taste of truffles greatly improves the stuffing. If 
 sweetbreads are used, put them on the fire with 
 a piece of butter and season with salt and pepper. 
 When they have begun to take color, complete 
 the cooking with some brown stock, then cut 
 them in pieces as little as a bean. Add one or 
 two spoons of Balsamella (see No. 54) a little 
 tongue, one or two slices of ham cut in little 
 squares, a pinch of grated cheese and a taste of 
 nutmeg, seeing that the ingredients are in such
stirring continually. When the liquid has become, through the cooking, like a cream, pour it 
 on the string beans that you will keep on the fire 
 a little longer, with the sauce. The string beans so 
 prepared can be served with boiled beef.

 STRING BEANS WITH EGG SAUCE 
 (Fagiuolini in salsa d ' uovo)
 
 Take less than a pound of string beans, cutting 
 off the two points and removing all the strings, 
 and then cook them partially in water moderately 
 salted. Take them from the kettle, drain, and 
 brown with butter, salt and pepper. Beat one 
 yolk with a teaspoonful of flour and the juice of 
 half a small lemon, dilute with half a cup of cold 
 broth from which the fat has been removed and 
 put this liquid on the fire in a small saucepan 
 stirring continually. When the liquid has become, through the cooking, like a cream, pour it 
 on the string beans that you will keep on the fire

 Prepare a Balsamella sauce (No. 54) with a 
 small piece of butter, half a teaspoonful of flour 
 and half a cup of milk. With this, a tablespoonful of grated cheese and four beaten eggs bind 
 the string beans when they are cold, mix and put 
 in a mold, evenly greased with butter and the 
 bottom covered with paper. Cook in a double 
 boiler and serve hot.

CAULIFLOWER IN MOLD 
 (Sformato di cavolfiore) 
  
 Take a good sized cauliflower, remove the 
 stalk and outside leaves, half cook it in water 
 and then cut it into small pieces. Salt them 
 and put them to brown with a little piece of butter and then complete the cooking with a cup 
 of milk. Then rub them through a sieve. Prepare a Balsamella (No. 54) and add it to the cauliflower with 3 beaten eggs and a tablespoonful of

ARTICHOKES IN MOLD 
 (Sformato di carciofi) 
  
 Remove the outside leaves of the artichokes, 
 the harder part of all leaves, and clean the stalks 
 without removing them. 
 Cut each artichoke into four parts and put 
 them to boil in salt water for only five minutes. 
 If left longer on the fire they become too 
 soaked in water and lose their taste. Remove 
 from the water, drain them, grind or pound and 
 rub them through a sieve. Season the pulp so 
 obtained with two or three beaten eggs, two or 
 three tablespoonfuls of Balsamella (No. 54) 
 grated cheese, salt and a taste of nutmeg, but 
 taste the seasoning several times to see that it is 
 correctly dosed. 
 Place in a mold with brown stock or meat 
 gravy (in that case use a mold with a hole) and 
 cook in double boiler.

 FRIED MUSHROOMS 
 (Funghi fritti) 
  
 Choose middle-sized mushrooms, which are
one or two cloves of oil and some mint leaves. 
 When the oil begins to splutter, put the mushrooms in without dipping in flour, season with 
 salt and pepper and when they are half cooked 
 pour in some tomato sauce. Be sparing however, 
 with the seasoning, in order that the mushrooms 
 do not absorb it too much and so lose some of 
 their own delicate flavor. 
  
 99 
 DRIED MUSHROOMS 
 (Funghi secchi) 
  
 Mushrooms are an excellent condiment of various dishes and for this reason it is well to have 
 some always at hand. Since, however, it is not 
  
 74 
  
 pleasant odor. Then cut them in rather large 
 slices and dip them in flour before putting in the 
 frying pan. Olive oil is best for frying mushrooms
and the seasoning is composed exclusively of salt 
 and pepper to be applied when they are frying. 
 They can also be dipped in beaten eggs after being sprinkled with flour, but this is superfluous. 
  
 98 
 STEWED MUSHROOMS 
 (Funghi in umido) 
  
 For a stew the mushrooms ought to be below 
 middle-size. Clean, wash and cut as for the preceding. Put a saucepan on the fire with olive oil, 
 one or two cloves of oil and some mint leaves. 
 When the oil begins to splutter, put the mushrooms in without dipping in flour, season with 
 salt and pepper and when they are half cooked 
 pour in some tomato sauce. Be sparing however, 
 with the seasoning, in order that the mushrooms

interior leaves to put them with the stuffing. 
 This, if to be used, for example, for six artichokes, 
 must be composed of the above small leaves, ⅛ 
 lb. of ham more lean than fat, one fourth of a 
 small onion, just a taste of garlic, some leaves of 
 celery or parsley, a pinch of dry mushrooms, 
 softened in water, a crumb of bread and a pinch of 
 pepper, but no salt. 
 First chop the ham, then grind everything together and with the hash fill the artichokes, and 
 put them to cook standing on their stalks in a 
 saucepan with some oil, salt and pepper. Some 
 prefer to give the artichokes a half cooking in 
 water before stuffing it, but it is hardly advisable, 
 because in this way they lose part of their special 
 flavor.

 and give it half cooking in salt wat6r. Put it upside down to drain, then open the leaves one by 
 one until the heart is exposed and on this put the 
 stuffing. Bring up all the leaves, close them and 
 tie with thread crosswise. 
 The stuffing can be made with milk veal 
 stewed alone, or with sweetbread or chicken 
 liver, all chopped fine. To make it more delicate, 
 add some balsamella (No 54) a pinch of grated 
 cheese, one yolk of egg and a taste of nutmeg. 
 Complete the cooking of the cabbage in the sauce of this stew, adding a little butter, on a low 
 fire or in the oven kept low. 
 Instead of filling the whole cabbage, the larger 
 leaves may be filled one by one, rolling and tying them.

 ASPARAGUS 
 (Sparagi) 
  
 Asparagus can be prepared in many different 
 ways, but the simplest and best is that of boiling them and serving them seasoned with olive 
 oil and vinegar or lemon juice. However there 
 are other ways as, for instance, the following: 
 Put them whole to brown a little with the green 
 part in butter and, after seasoning them with 
 salt, pepper and a pinch of grated cheese, pour
over the melted butter when it is browned. Or 
 else divide the white from the green part and place 
 them as follows in a fireproof plate: Dust the 
 bottom with grated cheese and dispose over the 
 points of the asparagus one near the other; 
 season with salt, pepper, grated cheese and little 
 pieces of butter. Make another layer of asparagus 
 and, seasoning in the same way, continue until 
 you have them. Be moderate in the seasoning. 
 Cross the layers of asparagus like a trestle, put 
 on the oven and keep until the seasoning, is 
 melted. Serve hot. 
 If you have some brown stock, parboil them 
 first and complete the cooking with brown stock,
