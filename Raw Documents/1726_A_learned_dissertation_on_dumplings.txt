 
 O BRAUND, my Patron! my Pleasure! my Pride! disdain 
 not to grace my Labours with a kind Perusal. Suspend 
 a-while your more momentous Cares, and condescend to 
 taste this little _Fricassee_ of Mine. 
  
 I write not this, to Bite you by the Ear, (_i.e._) 
 flatter you out of a Brace or two of Guinea ' s: No; 
 as I am a true _Dumpling Eater_, my Views are purely 
 _Epicurean_, and my utmost Hopes center ' d in partaking 
 of some elegant _Quelque Chose_ tost up by your 
 judicious Hand. I regard Money but as a Ticket which 
 admits me to your Delicate Entertainments; to me much 
 more Agreeable than all the Monkey-Tricks of Rival 
 _Harlequins_, or _Puppet-Show_ Finery of Contending 
 _Theatres_. 
  
 The Plague and fatigue of Dependance and Attendance, 
 which call me so often to the Court-end of the Town, 
 were insupportable, but for the Relief I find at
 ' em a Place in History. 
  
 The Invention of Eggs was merely accidental, two or 
 three of which having casually roll ' d from off a Shelf 
 into a Pudding which a good Wife was making, she found 
 herself under a Necessity either of throwing away her 
 Pudding, or letting the Eggs remain, but concluding 
 from the innocent Quality of the Eggs, that they would 
 do no Hurt, if they did no Good. She wisely jumbl ' d 
  ' em all together, after having carefully pick ' d out 
 the Shells; the Consequence is easily imagined, the 
 Pudding became a Pudding of Puddings; and the Use of 
 Eggs from thence took its Date. The Woman was sent for 
 to Court to make Puddings for King _John_, who then 
 sway ' d the Scepter; and gain ' d such Favour, that she 
 was the making of her whole Family. I cannot conclude 
 this Paragraph without owning, I received this 
 important Part of the History of Pudding from old Mr. 
 _Lawrence_ of _Wilsden-Green_, the greatest Antiquary 
 of the present Age.
 
 From that Time the _English_ became so famous for 
 Puddings, that they are call ' d Pudding-Eaters all over 
 the World, to this Day. 
  
 At her Demise, her Son was taken into Favour, and made 
 the King ' s chief Cook; and so great was his Fame for 
 Puddings, that he was call ' d _Jack Pudding_ all over 
 the Kingdom, tho '  in Truth, his real Name was _John 
 Brand_, as by the Records of the Kitchen you will 
 find: This _John Brand_, or _Jack-Pudding_, call him 
 which you please, the _French_ have it _Jean Boudin_, 
 for his Fame had reached _France_, whose King would 
 have given the World to have had our _Jack_ for his 
 Pudding-Maker. This _Jack Pudding_, I say, became yet 
 a greater Favourite than his Mother, insomuch that he 
 had the King ' s Ear as well as his Mouth at Command; 
 for the King, you must know, was a mighty Lover of 
 Pudding; and _Jack_ fitted him to a Hair, he knew how 
 to make the most of a Pudding; no Pudding came amiss
always wore as a Mark of his Sovereign ' s Favour; in 
 short, _Jack Pudding_, or Sir _John_, grew to be all 
 in all with good King _John_; he did nothing without 
 him, they were Finger and Glove; and, if we may 
 believe Tradition, our very good Friend had no small 
 Hand in the _Magna Charta_. If so, how much are all 
 _Englishmen_ indebted to him? in what Repute ought the 
 Order of the Gridiron to be, which was instituted to 
 do Honour to this Wonderful Man? But alas! how soon is 
 Merit forgot? how impudently do the Vulgar turn the 
 most serious Things into Ridicule, and mock the most 
 solemn Trophies of Honour? for now every Fool at a 
 Fair, or Zany at a Mountebank ' s Stage, is call ' d _Jack 
 Pudding_, has a Gridiron at his Back, and a great Pair 
 of Spectacles at his Buttocks, to ridicule the most 
 noble Order of the Gridiron. But their Spectacles is a 
 most ungrateful Reflection on the Memory of that great 
 Man, whose indefatigable Application to his Business, 
 and deep Study in that occult Science, rendred him 
 Poreblind; to remedy which Misfortune, he had always a
Obligation was over: Which made Sir _John_ compose 
 that excellent Proverb, _Not a word of the Pudding_. 
 And finding all Means ineffectual, he left the Court 
 in a great Pet; yet not without passing a severe Joke 
 upon  ' em, in his way, which was this; He sent a 
 Pudding to the King ' s Table, under the Name of a 
 _Court-Pudding_, or _Promise-Pudding_. This Pudding he 
 did not fail to set off with large Encomiums; assuring 
 the King, That therein he wou ' d find an Hieroglyphical 
 Definition of Courtiers Promises and Friendship. 
  
 This caused some Speculation; and the King ' s Physician 
 debarr ' d the King from tasting the Pudding, not 
 knowing but that Sir _John_ had poison ' d it. 
  
 But how great a Fit of Laughter ensu ' d, may be easily 
 guess ' d, when the Pudding was cut up, it prov ' d only a 
 large Bladder, just clos ' d over with Paste: The 
 Bladder was full of Wind, and nothing else, excepting 
 these Verses written in a Roll of Paper, and put in,
executed, so not one of the King ' s Cooks cou ' d make a 
 Pudding like Sir _John_; nay, tho '  he made a Pudding 
 before their Eyes, yet they out of the very same 
 Materials could not do the like. Which made his old 
 Friends the Monks attribute it to Witchcraft, and it 
 was currently reported the Devil was his Helper. But 
 good King _Harry_ was not to be fobb ' d off so; the 
 Pudding was good, it sate very well on his Stomach, 
 and he eat very savourly, without the least Remorse of 
 Conscience. 
  
 In short, Sir _John_ grew in Favour in spite of their 
 Teeth: The King lov ' d a merry Joke; and Sir _John_ had 
 always his Budget full of Punns, Connundrums and 
 Carrawitchets; not to forgot the Quibbles and 
 Fly-flaps he play ' d against his Adversaries, at which 
 the King has laugh ' d  ' till his Sides crackt. 
  
 Sir _John_, tho '  he was no very great Scholar, yet had 
 a happy way of Expressing himself: He was a Man of the
most Engaging Address, and never fail ' d to draw 
 Attention: Plenty and Good-Nature smil ' d in his Face; 
 his Muscles were never distorted with Anger or 
 Contemplation, but an eternal Smile drew up the 
 Corners of his Mouth; his very Eyes laugh ' d; and as 
 for his Chin it was three-double, a-down which hung a 
 goodly Whey-colour ' d Beard shining with the Drippings 
 of his Luxury; for you must know he was a great 
 Epicure, and had a very Sensible Mouth; he thought 
 nothing too-good for himself, all his Care was for his 
 Belly; and his Palate was so exquisite, that it was 
 the perfect Standard of Tasting. So that to him we owe 
 all that is elegant in Eating: For Pudding was not his 
 only Talent, he was a great Virtuoso in all manner of 
 Eatables; and tho '  he might come short of _Lambert_ 
 for Confectionary-Niceties, yet was he not inferiour 
 to _Brawnd_, _Lebec_, _Pede_, or any other great 
 Masters of Cookery; he could toss up a Fricass√©e as 
 well as a Pancake: And most of the Kickshaws now in 
 vogue, are but his Inventions, with other Names; for
Life, is, properly speaking, a Bak ' d Wheat-Pudding. 
  
 To the Satchel, which is the Pudding-Bag of Ingenuity, 
 we are indebted for the greatest Men in Church and 
 State. All Arts and Sciences owe their Original to 
 Pudding or Dumpling. What is a Bag-Pipe, the Mother of 
 all Music, but a Pudding of Harmony. And what is Music 
 it self, but a Palatable Cookery of Sounds. To little 
 Puddings or Bladders of Colours we owe all the choice 
 Originals of the Greatest Painters: And indeed, what 
 is Painting, but a well-spread Pudding, or Cookery of 
 Colours. 
  
 The Head of Man is like a Pudding: And whence have all 
 Rhimes, Poems, Plots and Inventions sprang, but from 
 that same Pudding. What is Poetry, but a Pudding of 
 Words. The Physicians, tho '  they cry out so much 
 against Cooks and Cookery, yet are but Cooks 
 themselves; with this difference only, the Cooks 
 Pudding lengthens Life, the Physicians shortens it.
So that we Live and Die by Pudding. For what is a 
 Clyster, but a Bag-Pudding; a Pill, but a Dumpling; 
 or a Bolus, but a Tansy, tho '  not altogether so 
 Toothsome. In a word; Physick is only a Puddingizing 
 or Cookery of Drugs. The Law is but a Cookery of 
 Quibbles and Contentions. [a] * * * * * * * * * * *

 so that it may rather be call ' d a Heap, than a 
 Pudding. Others are so Squeamish, the greatest 
 Mastership in Cookery is requir ' d to make the Pudding 
 Palatable: The Suet which others gape and swallow by 
 Gobs, must for these puny Stomachs be minced to Atoms; 
 the Plums must be pick ' d with the utmost Care, and 
 every Ingredient proportion ' d to the greatest Nicety, 
 or it will never go down.

_Prior_ gave him Ease, by furnishing him with the Word 
 _Connoissance_. Our D--n had drawn a Drole, Parallel 
 to this, _viz._ _Boudineur_, a Pudding Pyeman; and 
 _Boudinance_, the making of Pudding Pies: But several 
 Men of Quality begging it off, it was, at their 
 Request, scratch ' d out, but my Friend, the 
 _Amanuensis_, remembers particularly its being 
 originally inserted. 
  
 If the Reader should ask, Who is that K-- _John_ 
 mentioned in the fourth Page, and which I ought to 
 have taken in its Place. I beg leave to inform him, 
 that by K. _John_ is meant the late Q. ----, with whom 
 the D-- of _M----_ was many Years in such great 
 Favour, that he was nick named K. _John_; it was in 
 that Part of the Q-- ' s Reign, that Sir _John_ Pudding, 
 by whom is meant **** _you know who_, came in Favour; 
 it is true, the Name is odd, and seems to carry an Air 
 of Ridicule with it, but the Character given him by 
 this allegorical Writer, is that of an able Statesman,
and an honest Man. 
  
 And here, begging Mr. D--n ' s Pardon, I cannot but 
 think his Wit has out run his Judgment; for he puts 
 the Cart before the Horse, and begins at the latter 
 Part of Sir **** Administration: But this might be 
 owing to too plentiful a Dinner, and too much of the 
 Creature. Be that as it will, I must follow my Copy, 
 and explain it as it lies. Proceed we therefore to the 
 Dissertation, _Page 6._ 
  
 "But what rais ' d our Hero most in the Esteem of this 
 Pudding-eating Monarch, was his second Edition of 
 Pudding, he being the first that ever invented the Art 
 of broiling Puddings, which he did to such Perfection, 
 and so much to the King ' s liking (who had a mortal 
 Aversion to cold Pudding) that he thereupon instituted 
 him Knight of the Gridiron, and gave him a Gridiron of 
 Gold, the Ensign of that Order; which he always wore 
 as a Mark of his Sovereign ' s Favour."
sometimes Twenty-Years backwards, at other Times 
 advancing as many; so that one knows not where to have 
 him: for in his fifteenth Page, he returns to the 
 present Scene of Action, and brings his Hero into the 
 Favour of K---- _Harry_, _alias_ **** who being 
 sensible of his Abilities, restores him into Favour, 
 and makes Use of his admirable Skill in Cookery, 
 _alias_ State Affairs. 
  
 "Not one of the King ' s Cooks could make a Pudding like

 In his 23d Page, he has another confounded Fling at 
 Foreigners; and after having determinately dubb ' d his 
 Hero, the Prince of Statesmen, he concludes his 
 Dissertation with a Mess of Drollery, and goes off in 
 a Laugh. 
  
 In a Word, the whole Dissertation seems calculated to 
 ingratiate the D--n in Sir **** Favour; he draws the 
 Picture of an able and an honest Minister, painful in 
 his Countries Service, and beloved by his Prince; yet 
 oftentimes misrepresented and bely ' d: Nay, sometimes 
 on the Brink of Ruin, but always Conqueror. The Fears, 
 the Jealousies, the Misrepresentations of an enraged 
 and disappointed Party, give him no small Uneasiness 
 to see the Ingratitude of some Men, the Folly of 
 others, who shall believe black to be white, because 
 prejudiced and designing Knaves alarm  ' em with false 
 Fears. We see every Action misconstrued, and Evil made 
 out of Good; but as the best Persons and Things are
