 We  all  know  the  difference  in  the  taste  of  a piece  of  pie-crust  before  it  is  baked 
 and  afterwards — one  tastes  of  the  flour,  the  other  has  a rich  taste  altogether  different. 
 Just  such  is  the  difference  between  ordinary  butter  and  flour  and  brown  thickening. 
 In  making  thick  mock-turtle  soup,  brown  thickening  is  used  to  impart  that  rich 
 flavour  which  is  the  characteristic  of  all  thick  soups.  It  would  be  a most  instructive 
 experiment  to  a young  cook  if  she  has  a trustworthy  taste  to  try  the  difference  in 
 the  flavour  of  a little  good  stock  or  soup ; the  one  thickened  with  ordinary  butter 
 and  flour  raw,  and  the  other  with  brown  thickening,  which  we  will  now  describe 
 how  to  make  at  somewhat  fuller  length  than  would  be  justifiable  in  a receipt  which, 
 as  we  have  before  said,  necessarily  presupposes  a certain  amount  of  knowledge. 
 Suppose,  then,  a cook  to  possess  some  fine  dry  flour — say  half  a pound — the  same 
 quantity  of  butter,  an  enamelled  stewpan,  a clear  brisk  fire,  and  an  onion.  First 
 place  the  butter  in  the  stewpan,  and  melt  it  till  it  runs  to  what  cooks  call  oil.  It 
 will  be.  found  that  there  is  a white  scum  at  the  top,  and  a milky  sediment  at  the
 
 cassell’s  dictionary  of  cookery. 
  
  
 few  glasses  of  port  after,  and  generally  took  beer  witli  dinner  as  well.  Claret  was 
 considered  a somewhat  expensive  luxury,  and  when  introduced  was  generally  brought 
 on  only  at  dessert  for  the  purpose  of  finishing  up  with,  being  often  drunk  after  port. 
 Now,  however,  it  is  a most  common  custom  to  drink  claret  with  dinner  instead  of 
 beer.  Of  course  the  reason  is  that  claret,  and  good  claret  too,  can  be  now  obtained 
 in  this  country  at  a very  cheap  rate.  Indeed,  a most  excellent  sound  claret  can 
 be  bought  for  16  s.  a dozen — only  go  to  a respectable  wine  merchant,  and  always 
 taste  the  wine  before  you  buy  it. 
  
 We  will  now  endeavour  to  examine  into  the  general  principles  to  be  observed  in 
 the  service  of  wine.  For  instance,  we  know  that  it  is  customary  to  take  a glass  of 
 Chablis  with  oysters,  a glass  of  Madeira  after  turtle  soup,  a glass  of  dry  sherry  with 
 fish,  &c.,  but  why  we  do  so  is  by  no  means  so  evident.  Nature  seems  to  tell  us  that 
 port  wine  would  be  unsuitable  with  fish,  nor  do  we  think  any  one  would  care  to  sip 
 hock,  however  good,  with  walnuts. 
 
However,  we  learn  by  experience  that  there  are  certain  flavours  that  combine 
 together,  and  apparently  suit,  and  others  that  do  not.  For  instance,  Chablis  after 
 oysters.  Oysters  have  a strong  flavour,  and  a light  thin  wine  like  Chablis  cleanses 
 the  palate  after  eating  them,  and  somehow  the  oyster  seems  to  make  the  wine  taste 
 better.  On  the  other  hand,  try  a glassful  of  champagne  after  eating  oysters,  and  you 
 will  find  that  you  cannot  detect  the  flavour  of  the  champagne  at  all.  Again,  turtle 
 is  a rich,  glutinous  soup,  and  after  a very  rich  dish  some  wine  is  required  to  cleanse 
 the  palate  of  a more  generous  nature  than.  Chablis  or  hock : consequently,  Madeira,  or 
 good  East  India  sherry,  or  rum  punch,  is  taken. 
  
 After  a light  entree,  such  as  a Vol-au-vent  a la  Financiere,  or  boiled  fish  of  any 
 kind,  or  whitebait,  hock  or  pale  sherry  would  be  most  appropriate.  After  a rich 
 and  glutinous  fish  like  stewed  eels,  or  after  any  entree  with  strong  l ' ich  brown  gravy, 
 the  palate  requires  something  rather  more  stimulating,  and,  in  my  opinion,  no  wine 
 in  the  world  is  equal  to  Burgundy  to  drink  with  dinner,  either  with  water  or  with- 
 out. Still,  claret,  though  not  so  stimulating,  is  an  admirable  wine  to  drink  after 
 rich  dishes. 
  
 I think  it  will  be  found  that  the  general  principle,  that  the  richer  the  dish  the 
 more  stimulating  must  be  the  -wine,  holds  true  for  nearly  all  kinds  of  food.  For
instance,  roast  pork  is  a rich  dish,  and  it  is  one  of  the  few  kinds  of  food  that  persons 
 drink  port  wine  after.  Roast  goose  is  another  rich  dish,  and  it  is  customary  after 
 eating  roast  goose  to  have  a small  liquor  glass  of  brandy. 
  
 I have  a little  further  on  quoted  Francatelli’s  opinion  with  regard  to  the  service 
 of  wine,  and  it  will  be  seen  that  he  particularly  calls  attention  to  the  absurd  custom 
 of  serving  sweet  champagne  early  in  dinner.  As  a rule,  however,  champagne  is 
 generally  dry  in  this  country.  The  Duke  de  Montebello’s  sec,  Pommery  and  Greno’s 
 extra  sec,  and  Heidseck’s  Monopole,  are  all  admirable  dry  wines,  and  we  think 
 the  former,  though  not  equal  in  repute  to  the  two  latter,  is  quite  their  equal,  both 
 in  quality  and  flavour. 
  
 I would,  however,  caution  persons  against  introducing  champagne  early  in  the 
 dinner  at  all,  whether  it  be  dry  or  not.  Indeed,  it  will  be  found  best  if  the  cham- 
 pagne be  dry  not  to  serve  it  till  the  pRce  de  resistance  has  made  its  appearance. 
 If  the  champagne  be  at  all  sweet,  it  had  better  not  be  served  till  the  sweets. 
  
 The  French  taste  is  far  sweeter  than  the  English:  for  instance,  you  will  often 
 see  a body  of  grown-up  Frenchmen  enjoying  sweets  and  dessert,  including  even 
 sugar  plums,  in  a way  that  in  England  is  only  seen  with  young  children.  Cham-

 pagne  in  France  is  almost  universally  drank  after  dinner  in  the  same  way  in  which 
 we  should  finish  up  with  a bottle  of  claret.  But  then  it  should  be  remembered  that 
 the  majority  of  the  champagne  in  France  is  very  sweet ; the  champagne-growers 
 adapting  nearly  the  whole  of  the  wine  that  is  sent  to  England  to  suit  the  English 
 taste,  and  it  will  generally  be  found  that  champagne  in  England  has  the  word 
 “ England  ” branded  on  the  side  of  the  cork. 
  
 How  far  the  French  are  right  and  we  wrong,  or  vice  versd,  in  thus  preferring 
 swreet  champagne  to  dry  is  a matter  of  taste.  However, . there  can  be  no  doubt  that 
 the  taste  for  dry  wines  can  be  carried  too  far,  and  that  there  should  be  some  limit 
 beyond  which  the  dryness  of  a wine  should  not  be  carried.  For  instance,  take  the 
 case  of  the  Duke  of  Montebello’s  first  brand  : there  is  the  sec  and  the  maximum
country  produces.  There  are  samples  that  correspond  to  Hock,  Sherry,  Burgundy, 
 Claret,  and  Madeira.  We  will  first  take  the  kind  that  resembles  hock.  This  is  called 
 Riesling • it  is  a thin  light  wine,  sold  in  hock  bottles,  and  is  an  exceedingly  pleasant 
 drink  in  summer,  and  is  particularly  suitable  with  boiled  fish,  or  after  light  entrees, 
 such  as  vol-au-vents.  Highercombe  is  another  wine  resembling  hock,  or  rather 
 Haut  Barsac  or  Sauterne.  Highercombe  is  a strong-scented  wine,  and  would 
 probably  not  be  liked  by  those  who  are  partial  to  an  exceedingly  dry  sherry. 
 On  the  other  hand,  when  the  taste  for  this  wine  has  been  acquired,  it  is  generally 
 very  strongly  fancied.  Some  of  this  wine  mixed  with  a bottle  of  soda-water  will  be 
 found  a most  refreshing  drink.  Another  Australian  wine  very  much  resembling 
 hock  is  Gouais ; this  wine  is  something  between  hock  and  Sauterne,  and,  as  it  can 
 be  bought  for  24s.  a dozen,  is  well  worth  a trial.  The  next  class  of  wines  to  which 
 we  would  refer  is  the  white  Australian  wines  that  resemble  sherry.  First  we 
 will  take  Fairfield  (amber).  This  wine  very  much  resembles  Cape  Sherry,  and  is 
 certjcinly  inferior  to  ordinary  good  sherry ; it  also  has  a slight  resemblance  to  the 
 home-made  wine  one  occasionally  tastes  at  farmhouses  that  is  made  from  rhubarb. 
 This  wine  is,  however,  very  wholesome,  and  probably  after  a time  would  be  very 
 palatable  when  the  taste  for  it  is  once  acquired.  A very  superior  wine,  however,  is 
 met  with  in  V erdeilho ; this  is  made  from  vines  resembling  those  in  Madeira,  and 
 
even  cheaper,  and,  when  the  specimens  are  good,  is  well  worth  double  the  money. 
 We  would  strongly  advise  connoisseurs  and  epicures  to  make  a trial.  A very 
 delicious  cup,  superior  to  Moselle  cup,  can  be  made  from  this  wine,  by  mixing  it 
 with  soda-water,  sugar,  a few  slices  of  lemon,  and  a lump  of  ice.  This  makes  a 
 cheap  and  very  refreshing  drink  in  summer. 
  
 We  next  come  to  the  Australian  red  wines,  which,  as  a rule,  will  be  found  very 
 superior  to  the  white.  The  finest  Australian  red  wine  that  I have  ever  tasted  is 
 called  Carbenet.  This  fine  wine  has  a most  beautiful  bouquet,  resembling  good 
 Chateau  Margaux  claret.  It  resembles  Burgundy  in  flavour,  with  perhaps  a 
 very  slight  port  flavour  added.  Or  it  may  be  compared  to  a veiy  dry  Bousillon. 
 This  wine  is  very  soft,  and  this,  coupled  with  its  rich-scented  bouquet,  entitles  it 
 to  rank  high  among  the  Australian  wines.  Indeed,  it  is  far  supei’ior  to  the  general 
 run  of  Burgundies  and  clarets  that  can  be  bought  at  the  same  price,  which  is  about 
 36s.  a dozen.  Fairfield  (ruby)  is  another  red  wine,  somewhat  resembling  dry  port. 
 The  bouquet  of  this  wine  is  very  inferior  to  Carbenet,  and  it  has  a rather  dead  taste, 
 in  which  can  be  detected  a slight  flavour  of  raisins.  Perhaps  the  next  best  wine  to 
 Carbenet  is  Mataro ; this  is  also  similar  to  a dry  port  or  Burgundy ; it  has  a good 
 bouquet,  and  is  well  worth  the  price  at  which  it  is  generally  sold.  Chaselas  is  a 
 red  wine,  but  is  somewhat  poor  and  acid.  A better  wine  is  Hermitage,  which
somewhat  resembles  the  Hermitage  made  on  the  banks  of  the  Rhone,  and  is  pro- 
 bably named  after  it.  A very  peculiar  Australian  wine  is  made  called  Conatto ; 
 this  is  a rich  liqueur,  with  a slightly  medicinal  flavour  in  it ; its  taste  reminds  one 
 of  rum  shrub  and  curatjoa.  Again,  it  is  sometimes  like  Constantia,  and  is  probably 
 made  from  the  same  kind  of  grapes  that  are  used  for  Constantia.  Red  Albury  is  a 
 scented  wine  resembling  somewhat  English  home-made  raisin  wine,  only  it  is  better. 
 It  is  a capital  wine  for  children,  and  would  suit  those  who  like  a sweet  port.  These 
 are  the  chief  wines  of  Australia,  which,  in  our  opinion,  are  destined  in  a few  years’ 
 time  to  become  far  better  known  than  they  are  at  present ; and  Englishmen  on 
 patriotic  grounds  should  at  any  rate  give  Australian  wines  a trial,  if  their  order  does 
 not  extend  beyond  a single  bottle. 
  
 We  have  now  run  through  the  principal  wines  drunk  in  this  country,  and  have 
 taken  exceptional  notice  of  Australian  wine,  which  is  but  little  known,  owing 
 to  the  fact  of  its  being  the  only  wine  worthy  of  the  name  that  is  produced  in  the 
 British  dominions.  Hungarian  wine,  Italian  wine,  Swiss  wine,  are  all  worth  a 
 trial,  especially  the  former.  We  ought  not,  however,  to  forget  to  mention  our 
 national  beverage — Beer ! 
  
 First,  I do  not  wish  to  touch  upon  the  point  of  making  home-brewed  beer — in
half  an  hour.  Probable  cost,  8d.  Sufficient 
 for  six  persons. 
  
 Apple  Pudding,  Baked  (another  way). 
 — Fill  the  dish  as  in  the  preceding  recipe,  but 
 instead  of  pouring  a cupful  of  cold  water  over 
 all,  pour  three  or  four  eggs  beaten  with  a little 
 new  milk.  Bake  in  a quick  oven.  Sift  sugar 
 over  the  top,  and  serve  with  sweet  sauce.  Time 
 to  bake,  three-quarters  of  an  hour.  Probable 
 cost,  Is.  2d.  Sufficient  for  six  persons. 
  
 Apple  Pudding,  Baked  (another  way). 
 — Put  a dozen  apples  into  a saucepan  with 
 enough  water  to  keep  them  from  burning,  a piece 
 of  butter,  a little  powdered  cinnamon,  and  sugar 
 according  to  taste.  Let  them  simmer  gently 
 until  they  fall,  then  beat  them  well.  Place 
 them  in  the  middle  of  a pie-dish,  and  pour 
 round  and  over  them  a good  thitk  arrowroot
custard.  Put  into  a quick  oven,  and  bake  until 
 brown.  Time  to  brown,  twenty  minutes. 
 Probable  cost,  Is.  6d.  Sufficient  for  five  or  six 
 persons. 
  
 Apple  Pudding,  Baked,  Rich..— Line 
  
 a pie-dish  with  good  short  crust.  Stew  four 
 pounds  of  apples,  and  when  hot,  add  a quarter  '  
 of  a pound  of  butter.  Let  them  stand  aside  to 
 cool,  then  add  a cupful  of  cream,  four  well- 
 beaten  eggs,  sugar  to  taste,  grated  lemon-rind, 
 and  grated  nutmeg.  Stir  all  well  together, 
 then  place  the  mixture  in  the  pie-dish,  and 
 bake  in  a good  oven.  Serve  with  Devonshire 
 cream,  or  custard.  Time,  half  an  hour  to  bake. 
 Sufficient  for  six  persons.  Probable  cost,  3s. 
  
 Apple  Pudding,  Boiled. — Make  a light 
 batter  with  two  eggs,  four  heaped  table-spoon-
 
 BAT 
  
  
 Barberry  Syrup  for  Ice.  — Make  a 
 syrup  with  one  pound  of  good  sugar  and  a pint 
 of  water,  boiling  it  and  removing  the  scum,  for 
 twenty  minutes.  Put  in  half  a pound  of  fine 
 ripe  barberries  and  boil  ten  minutes.  Let  it  get 
 cold,  and  bottle  to  use  when  i e }uired.  Probable 
 cost,  4d.  to  6d.  per  pint. 
  
 Barberry  Water  Ice. — Squeeze  the 
 juice  from  half  a dozen  lemons  and  an  orange. 
 Pub  off  the  rind  of  three  lemons  on  lumps  of 
 sugar.  Mix  these  with  a pint  of  clarified  sugar, 
 a half  pint  of  water,  and  enough  barberry  syrup 
 to  flavour.  Strain  and  freeze,  or  use  lemon 
 water  ice,  and  add  syrup  and  colour  to  taste. 
 Time,  twenty-five  minutes  to  freeze.  Sufficient
for  one  quart. 
  
 Barley  Gruel. — The  colour  and  taste  of 
 gruel  is  much  improved  by  washing  the  seeds 
 and  throwing  off  the  first  water  after  it  has 
 boiled  a few  minutes.  Boil  three  ounces  of 
 pearl  barley  in  a pint  of  water  for  ten  minutes, 
 then  throw  it  off  and  put  to  it  two  quarts  of 
 boiling  water.  When  reduced  one  half  it  will  be 
 sufficiently  boiled.  Strain,  add  sugar,  lemon- 
 peel,  or  wine  to  taste,  and  simmer  for  a few 
 minutes. 
  
 Barley  Meal  Scones. — The  preparation 
 of  these  wholesome  cakes  is  a very  simple  pro- 
 cess. The  barley  meal,  with  the  addition  of 
 salt  to  taste,  should  be  mixed  with  hot  milk 
 till  it  forms  a thick  paste.  Roll  out  thin  and 
 cut  into  scones.  Bake  in  a quick  oven  or  on  a 
 griddle  over  a bright  fire.  They  should  be  but-
tered and  eaten  hot. 
  
 Barley  Soup  or  Broth.— Put  two 
  
 sheeps’  heads,  or  two  or  three  pounds  of  shin  of 
 beef,  in  a gallon  of  water.  Add  a tea-cupful  of 
 pearl  barley,  three  large  onions  cut  small,  a 
 small  bunch  of  parsley,  a few  potatoes  sliced,  a 
 little  thyme,  and  pepper  and  salt  to  taste. 
 Simmer  gently  for  three  or  four  hours,  and 
 frequently  stir  it  to  prevent  the  meat  from 
 burning.  It  should  not  be  allowed  to  boil. 
 Probable  cost,  6d.  per  quart. 
  
 Barley  Sugar. — Dissolve  lump  sugar,  boil 
 and  skim  it  until  it  is  crisp  and  clear,  and  no 
 scum  rises ; test  the  crispness  by  dropping  some 
 into  cold  water.  Flavour  with  lemon- juice  or 
 essence  of  lemon.  Pour  the  sugar  on  a slate, 
 stone,  or  marble  slab,  which  has  been  rubbed
the  onions  in  butter,  and  add  a gravy  instead  of 
 vinegar.  The  juice  of  a lemon  is  sometimes, 
 preferred. 
  
 Beans,  French,  Boiled. — Only  the  ends: 
 and  stalks  require  to  be  tdken  off  when  the 
 beans  are  very  young,  and  no  mode  of  cooking- 
 can  make  very  old  ones  eatable.  Put  them  as 
 they  are  prepared  into  cold  water.  They  are: 
 cut  according  to  taste  lengthwise  into  thin 
 strips  or  obliquely  into  a lozenge  form.  The 
 strings  should  be  drawn  off  with  the  tops  and 
 stalks  when  they  are  come  to  their  proper 
 growth.  Put  them  into  a large  saucepan  of 
 boiling  water,  some  salt  and  a little  soda,  and 
 keep  boiling  very  fast  until  tender.  Time, 
 fifteen  minutes  if  young ; twenty  to  twenty-five- 
 minutes  if  old.  Probable  cost,  2d.  to  4d.  per 
 pound. 
 
Beans,  French  (Haricots  verts). — Boil 
 and  drain  the  beans  in  the  usual  way,  and  put 
 them  into  a stewpan  with  some  butter  thickened 
 with  flour.  Add  chopped  parsley,  thyme,  chives, 
 &c.,  and  a small  cupful  of  stock ; season  to 
 taste  with  salt  and  pepper.  Stew  for  some  time, 
 then  thicken  with  two  eggs  well  beaten  up  with, 
 a little  milk  or  cream,  and  serve  quickly.  A 
 little  lemon- juice  may  also  be  added.  Time  tc>

 Beans,  French,  Omelet  of.  ~ Cut  up 
  
 two  table-spoonfuls  of  French  beans  into  small 
 pieces,  and  stir  them  into  four  eggs  which  have 
 been  previously  beaten ; next  add  two  table- 
 spoonfuls of  grated  Parmesan,  or  any  other  mild 
 cheese,  and  pepper  and  salt  to  taste.  When 
 thoroughly  mixed,  put  the  whole  into  a delicately 
 clean  omelet-pan  with  two  ounces  of  butter,  and 
 fry  a pale  brown.  Probable-  cost,  9d.  Time, 
 three  to  five  minutes.  Sufficient  for  three  or 
 four  persons. 
  
 Beans,  French,  Pickled. — Beans  are 
 seldom  pickled  alone,  but  are  classed  under  the 
 head  of  mixed  pickles.  They  may  bo  put  into 
 a jar  with  gherkins,  cauliflowers,  radish-pods,
glycerine  alternately,  l’robable  cost,  3s.  6d. 
 Sufficient  for  four  or  five  persons. 
  
 Beef  Fricadelles  are  best  when  made 
 with  beef,  mutton,  and  pork  in  equal  quantities, 
 and  cut  very  fine,  hut  either  will  do  separately. 
 If  beef,  take  one  pound  and  a half  of  nice  lean 
 i meat,  a quarter  of  a pound  of  butter,  four  eggs, 
 six  ounces  of  fine  bread-crumbs,  a cup  of  cold 
 | water,  and  salt  and  pepper  to  taste.  Mix  well 
 together  and  turn  out  a round  well-formed  cake. 
 Cover  with  raspings  and  cross  over  the  top  with 
 I a knife  ; put  it  on  a buttered  plate  and  bake  in 
 a quick  oven.  It  should  have  a nice  rich  brown 
 appearance,  or  it  may  be  half  stewed  and  then 
 completed  in  the  oven.  Time,  about  one  hour. 
 Probable  cost,  2s.  2d.  Sufficient  for  five  or  six 
 persons. 
  
 Beef  Fricadelles,  Spiced, — Prepare
the  meat  as  in  preceding  recipe,  adding  a little 
 more  butter,  some  grated  lemon,  cinnamon, 
 cloves,  or  spiced  sauces  to  taste,  and  cook  as 
 already  directed.  The  fricadelle  may  also  be 
 formed  into  small  halls,  and  fried  over  a clear 
 ; fire.  Time,  one  horn-. 
  
 Beef,  Fricandeau  of. — Lard  about  three 
 poimds  of  the  rump  or  fillet  of  sirloin.  Pound 
 three  or  four  cloves,  six  whole  allspice,  and  two 
 blades  of  mace.  Mix  a little  pepper  and  salt 
 with  these  ingredients,  and  sprinkle  it  over  the 
 meat.  Put  it  into  a stewpan  with  a pint  of 
 medium  stock,  a glass  of  white  wine,  a bunch 
 i of  savoury  herbs  tied  together,  two  shalots,  and 
 I a little  more  pepper  and  salt.  Stew  the  meat 
 very  slowly  for  two  hours,  when  it  will  be  done. 
  
 I Remove  it  from  the  stewpan  and  cover  to  keep 
 hot.  Skim  all  the  fat  from  the  gravy,  strain,
small  piece),  or  part  of  a brisket,  for  some 
 days ; then  simmer  it  in  a stewpan  with 
 some  allspice,  a carrot,  two  onions,  two 
 turnips,  and  salt  to  taste,  for  five  or  six  hours. 
 Dissolve  a piece  of  butter  in  a clean  stewpan, 
  
  
 and  mix  into  it  a dessert-spoonful  of  flour. 
 Add  one  quart  of  gravy,  a glassful  of  white 
 wine,  and  equal  quantities  of  ketchup  and 
 browning.  Then  cut  up  two  carrots  and  two 
 turnips,  flavour  all  with  salt  and  pepper,  and 
 stew  until  the  vegetables  are  quite  tender.  Put 
 the  meat  on  a dish,  and  pour  all,  first  clearing  it 
 from  any  fat,  over  it.  The  meat  may  be  glazed 
 or  browned  with  a salamander,  before  the 
 sauce  is  poured  over.  Probable  cost,  Is.  per 
 pound. 
  
 Beef,  with  Yorkshire  Pudding.—
 
 Take  eggs,  flour,  and  milk,  according  to  the 
 size  of  the  pudding  required.  Allow  an  egg  to 
 every  heaped  table-spoonful  of  flour,  and  salt  to 
 taste.  Trim  it  to  a proper  consistency  with 
 good  new  milk ; it  should  be  thinner  than  for 
 boiled  batter.  If  this  pudding  be  not  required 
 for  a large  family  a separate  compartment  may 
 be  used  for  it,  and  the  other  part  of  the  drip- 
 ping-pan may  receive  the  gravy  required  to 
 throw  over  the  meat.  In  any  case,  place  the 
 dripping-pan  and  joint  to  the  fire  till  the  fat 
 begins  to  flow,  before  the  batter  is  put  in,  and 
 stir  it  round  in  the  basin  that  no  sediment  may 
 remain.  See  that  it  cooks  evenly  and  that  the 
 edges  are  not  burned,  and  when  done  sufficiently 
 turn  if  liked.  Some  prefer  it  browned  on  one 
 side  only.  The  usual  thickness  is  about  an 
 inch  when  well  browned  on  both  sides.  Divide 
 into  pieces  sufficient  for  each  person,  and  send
it  to  table  quickly.  It  should  be  put  into  the 
 dripping  just  in  time  to  get  it  done  with  the 
 meat.  Time,  one  and  a half  to  two  hours. 
  
 Beer,  How  to  Treat  “ Foxed.” — 
  
 “Foxed”  beer  has  a rank  unpleasant  taste, 
 and  may  be  known  by  the  white  specks  float- 
 ing on  its  surface.  To  remedy  this,  infuse  a 
 handful  of  hops  and  a little  salt  of  tartar  in 
 a pint  of  boiling  water,  and,  when  cold,  strain 
 and  pour  into  the  cask,  closing  the  bunghole 
 at  once. 
  
 Beer  Soup  (German  method). — Simmer 
 two  quarts  of  mild  beer  (it  should  not  be  bitter) 
 with  the  thin  rind  of  a lemon,  a few  cloves,  and 
 a stick  of  cinnamon,  sweeten  with  sugar,  and 
 add  it  through  a sieve  to  the  yolks  of  six  well- 
 beaten  eggs  and  half  a pint  of  cream.  Whilst
stuff  the  capon,  the  head  may  be  cut  right  off, 
 and  the  skin  of  the  neck  skewered  over. 
  
 Capsicum,  Essence  of. — To  one  pint 
 of  brandy  or  rectified  spirits  of  wine  add  one 
 ounce  of  the  best  cayenne  pepper.  Let  it  infuse 
 for  three  weeks,  then  pour  oif  the  clear  liquid, 
 and  bottle  for  use.  It  is  very  convenient  to 
 have  this  essence  for  the  flavouring  of  sauces, 
 &c.,  as  the  taste  is  equally  and  quickly  diffused 
 by  stirring  a little  with  some  boiling  sauce. 
 Cayenne  varies  so  much  in  strength,  that  the 
 quantity  to  be  put  with  each  pint  of  sauce  or 
 gravy  must  be  regulated  by  the  taste  of  the 
 cook. 
  
 Capsicums,  Pickled. — Capsicums  may 
 be  pickled  either  green  or  red.  They  are 
 finest  and  ripest  in  September  and  October. 
 
follows: — Crush  a quarter  of  a pound  of  loaf 
 sugar  to  powder,  put  it  into  a saucepan  with  a 
 table-spoonful  of  water,  and  stir  it  unceasingly 
 over  a gentle  fire,  with  a wooden  spoon,  until 
 it  begins  to  acquire  a little  colour.  Draw  it 
 back  and  bake  it  very  slowly,  still  stirring  it, 
 until  it  is  almost  black,  without  being  in  the 
 least  burnt.  It  will  take  about  half  an  hour. 
 Pour  a quart  of  water  over  it,  let  it  boil  for  a 
 few  minutes  until  the  sugar  is  quite  dissolved, 
 pour  it  out,  and  when  cold  strain  it  into  a 
 bottle,  and  store  it  for  use.  A table-spoonful  of 
 this  browning  will  colour  half  a pint  of  liquid, 
 and  there  will  be  no  danger  of  an  unpleasant 
 taste  being  given  to  the  sauce,  &c.  The  addi- 
 tion of  a little  claret  or  mushroom  ketchup  will  . 
 often  impart  as  much  colouring  to  sauces  as  is 
 required.  When  it  is  wished  to  thicken  the 
 sauce  as  well  as  colour  it  brown  thickening 
 should  be  used.  Green. — Pound  some  young
 
 spinach  or  bcet-lca ves.  Press  out  the  juice  and 
 put  it  in  a cup.  Place  this  cup  in  a saucepan 
 of  boiling  water  and  let  it  simmor  gently,  to 
 take  off  the  raw  taste  of  the  juice.  Before 
 using  it,  mix  it  with  a little  finely-sifted  sugar. 
 Jiecl. — Two  or  three  drops  of  cochineal  will 
 impart  a beautiful  red  or  pink  colouring.  As 
 much  can  bo  made  at  home  for  2s.  as  will  cost 
 £1  Is.  if  bought  at  the  shops.  White. — Use 
 pounded  almonds,  arrowroot,  or  cream.  Yellow. 
 — For  a clear  yellow,  dissolve  orange  or  lemon 
 jelly.  For  an  opaque,  pound  the  yolks  of  eggs, 
 and  mix  it  with  the  liquid;  or,  add  a little 
 saffron ; or,  soak  the  flowers  of  the  crocus, 
 which  will  not  taste. 
  
 Compotes,  Syrup  for. — The  quantity 
 of  sugar  used  for  the  syrup  in  compotes  must 
 depend  upon  the  acidity  of  the  fruit.  For
five  persons. 
  
  
 COLLARED  EELS. 
  
  
 Eels,  Collared. — Take  a large  eel,  cut  off 
 the  head  and  tail,  and  remove  the  skin  and 
 backbone  without  tearing  the  flesh.  Spread 
 it  out  flat  on  a hoard,  and  cover  it  with  a season- 
 ing composed  of  the  following  ingredients : — • 
 A small  bunch  of  herbs,  two  leaves  of  sage 
  
  
 minced  very  fine,  two  cloves,  two  blades  of 
 mace,  and  a little  allspice  and  whole  pepper 
 well  pounded,  with  salt  to  taste.  Roll  up  the 
 eel,  beginning  with  the  broad  end,  and  bind  it 
 tightly  with  a tape.  Boil  down  the  backbone, 
 head,  and  tail  with  pepper,  salt,  mace,  and
vinegar.  Put  the  eel  to  this  liquor,  and  stew 
 about  three-quarters  of  an  hour,  and  when 
 tender  set  it  aside.  Boil  up  the  liquor  with 
 more  vinegar  and  spice,  if  required,  and  when 
 cool  add  it  to  the  fish.  Probable  cost,  6d.  to 
 Is.  per  pound. 
  
 Eels  (en  Matelote). — Cut  up  some  very 
 small  onions — five  or  six  of  them — and  brown 
 them  with  a little  butter  and  flour  in  a stew- 
 pan.  When  of  a light  brown,  add  about  half  a 
 pint  of  good  broth  and  the  same  quantity  of  port 
 wine,  a few  mushrooms,  a laurel-leaf , salt,  pepper, 
 and  nutmeg  to  taste.  Have  ready  two  pounds 
 of  eels,  divided  into  lengths  of  three  inches, 
 simmer  them  in  this  gravy  till  tender,  then 
 remove  the  eels  and  place  them  high  in  the 
 centre  of  a dish.  Thicken  the  sauce  with  butter 
 and  flour,  and  serve  it  hot  poured  over.  Time 
 to  stew  the  eels,  half  an  hour.  Probable  cost,
saucepan  one  or  two  glasses  of  white  wine,  with 
 half  the  quantity  of  water ; sweeten  to  taste,  and 
 add  a little  nutmeg.  Beat  well  in  a basin  one 
 or  two  eggs,  with  a spoonful  of  cold  water  to 
 each  egg ; pour  the  boiling  wine  very  slowly 
 into  the  basin,  stirring  steadily  all  the  time, 
 and  then  back  into  the  saucepan.  Hold  the 
 saucepan  with  one  hand  over  the  fire  for  only 
 a minute,  and  stir  with  the  other.  Do  not  let 
 the  contents  boil  or  they  will  be  spoiled.  Egg 
 wine  is  often  made  without  warming  the  egg,  in 
 which  state  it  is  lighter,  if  not  so  agreeable  to 
 the  taste. 
  
 Eggs  (a  la  Bonne  Femme) . — Get  six  eggs  of 
 the  same  size,  large  ones,  boil  them  ten  minutes, 
 and  when  cool  enough,  remove  the  shells  care- 
 fully. Divide  them  equally  in  halves,  take  out 
 the  yolks  and  cut  from  each  the  pointed  tip  of 
 
 
 Fruit,  Dish,  of  Mixed. — In  the  months 
 of  September  and  October  the  most  fastidious 
 fancy  may  be  gratified  through  the  facility 
  
  
 DISH  OF  MIXED  FRUIT. 
  
  
 afforded  of  collecting  a variety  of  mixed  fruits 
 for  a centre  dish.  It  only  requires  taste,  with 
 proper  regard  to  colour  and  contrast,  to  effect 
 a delicious  and  most  attractive  coup  d ' ceil.  One 
 ornament  for  the  centre  of  a dinner-table  is  a 
 large  gilt  basket  of  some  graceful  shape,  filled 
 with  every  kind  of  fruit,  interspersed  with 
 moss  and  fern-leaves.  Apples,  pears,  peaches, 
  
  
 pine-apples,  and  grapes  would  form  a lovely
combination  for  autumn  fruits,  the  crevices 
 filled  up  with  scarlet  geraniums  and  maiden- 
 hair fern ; this  for  a centre-piece,  surrounded 
 by  specimen  glasses,  with  a rose  or  camelia 
 in  each,  would  form  a most  attractive  coup 
 d '  ceil.  There  are  so  many  ways,  however,  of 
 displaying  taste  in  dressing  the  centre  of  a 
 table  and  of  arranging  fruit  desserts,  that  it 
 is  best  left  to  each  individual  fancy.  Suffice  it 
 to  say,  that  the  dish  should  never  be  too  full, 
 and  always  garnished  in  some  way,  either  with 
 leaves  or  tiny  sprays  of  flowers,  or  even  em- 
 broidered paper,  which  can  be  bought  for  the 
 purpose,  and  that  all  fruit  intended  for  table 
 should  be  carefully  wiped  with  a cloth  before 
 arranging  on  the  dish. 
  
 Fruit  Fritters. — Fritters  may  he  much 
 improved  by  adding  fruit  to  the  batter,  but  it 
 will  require  to  be  made  thicker  than  for
ordinary  fritters.  The  following  recipe  will 
 serve  for  many  kinds  of  fruits,  and  also  for 
 vegetables  : — Warm  half  a pint  of  milk,  in 
 which  stir-  two  ounces  of  butter ; make  it  into 
 a hatter,  with  about  ten  ounces  of  flour. 
 Sweeten  to  taste,  and  flavour  with  nutmeg, 
 cinnamon,  &c.,  and  a glass  of  any  liquor  or 
 brandy.  Stir  in  the  whites  of  two  eggs  well 
 whisked,  and  fry  at  once,  in  boiling  butter  or 
 lard  Fruits,  such  as  pine-apple,  apple,  orange, 
 peach,  &c.,  should  he  cut  in  slices,  dipped  in  the 
 batter,  fried  nicel} ' ,  and  when  dried  before  the 
 fire,  strewed  with  sifted  sugar.  Such  fruits  as 
 strawberries,  cherries,  apricots,  and  raspberries, 
 should  be  thrown  into  the  hatter,  and  a spoon- 
 ful poured  into  the  boiling  fat ; all  stones  must 
 be  previously  removed.  For  frying  vegetables, 
 mix  into  the  batter,  in  the  place  of  sugar,  &c., 
 savoury  herbs  and  salt.  Time,  about  ten 
 minutes  to  fry.  Sufficient  for  four  or  five
prove  a valuable  addition  to  sauces  and  salads. 
 The  flavour  may  be  increased  or  diminished 
 by  leaving  the  garlic  a longer  or  shorter  time 
 in  the  vinegar,  or  by  altering  the  proportion  of 
 garlic.  Before  straining  off  for  use  taste  two 
 or  three  drops,  and  see  if  the  flavour  is  such 
 as  will  be  liked. 
  
 Garnish. — In  dishing  meat  for  the  table, 
 garnishing  forms  a most  important  part,  as  it 
 is  highly  desirable  that  the  eye  should  be 
 satisfied  as  well  as  the  palate,  and  the  most 
 delicious  dish  may  not  be  enjoyed  if  its 
 appearance  be  against  it.  Vegetables  and 
 sauces  form  the  principal  garnish  for  meat 
 dishes.  It  is  evident,  however,  that  in  garnish- 
 ing very  much  must  depend  on  the  good  taste  of 
 the  cook,  and  the  material  at  her  command. 
 A general  idea  only  of  various  garnishes  can 
 be  given  here,  and  their  adaptation  must  be  left
cient for  one  hare. 
  
 Hare,  Forcemeat  for  (another  way). — 
 See  Forcemeat  for  Hare. 
  
 Hare,  Gateau  of. — Prepare  a hare  as  if 
 for  roasting.  Cut  it  into  joints.  The  best  parts — 
 the  back,  thighs,  and  shoulders — may  be  used  for 
 the  gateau,  and  the  remainder  for  a civet  or  for 
 soup.  Take  the  meat  from  the  skin  and  sinews, 
 cut  it  up,  and  pound  it  in  a mortar,  with  one 
 pound  of  the  neck  or  loin  of  veal,  half  a pound 
 of  fresh,  lean  pork,  and  a quarter  of  a pound  of 
 unsmoked  fat  bacon.  A table-spoonful  of  soup 
 or  stock  may  be  added  while  pounding,  so  as 
 to  make  the  meat  into  a smooth  paste.  Add 
 pepper,  salt,  and  cayenne  to  taste,  together  with 
 two  or  three  small  onions,  finely  minced,  and  a 
 tea-spoonful  of  chopped  parsley.  Beat  half  a 
 
 
 dozen  raw  eggs,  and  add  them  one  at  a time. 
 Line  the  bottom  and  sides  of  a baking-dish  with 
 slices  of  fat  bacon,  cut  very  thin.  Spread  the 
 chopped  meat  over  it,  about  an  inch  and  a half 
 in  thickness,  and  place  two  or  three  more  slices 
 upon  it.  Repeat  until  all  the  meat  is  used, 
 letting  bacon  be  uppermost.  Place  the  skin 
 of  the  bacon  or  a coarse  crust  of  flour  and 
 water  on  the  top  of  the  dish,  to  keep  in 
 the  juices,  and  bake  in  a moderate  oven.  If 
 the  oven  were  hot,  the  meat  would  be  hard  and 
 dry.  When  cool,  dip  the  dish  into  hot  water, 
 turn  out  the  cake,  place  on  a napkin,  and  garnish 
 according  to  taste.  This  dish  is  good  for  break- 
 fast or  luncheon,  and  will  keep  for  some  days. 
 It  should  be  eaten  cold.  Time,  about  four  hours 
 to  bake.  Probable  cost  of  hare,  3s.  6d.  to  6s. 
 Sufficient  for  six  or  eight  persons. 
 
Hare,  Gateau  of  (made  with  cold  dressed 
 hare). — Take  the  flesh  from  the  bones  of  a cold 
 roast  hare,  remove  the  skin  and  sinews,  cut  it 
 small,  and  pound  it  in  a mortar  with  the  liver 
 of  the  hare.  Take  half  the  weight  of  the  meat, 
 in  finely-grated  bread-crumbs,  soak  them  in  as 
 much  good  broth  as  they  null  absorb,  and  mix 
 them  with  the  pounded  meat.  Season  with  salt, 
 pepper,  and  spices,  according  to  taste,  together 
 with  a finely-minced  shallot,  and  a tea-spoonful 
 of  chopped  parsley.  Add  two  well-beaten  eggs. 
 Cover  the  inside  of  a mould  with  slices  of  bacon. 
 Put  in  the  pounded  meat,  lay  some  more  slices 
 on  the  top,  and  bake  in  a moderate  oven,  or  put 
 it  into  a saucepan  of  boiling  water,  and  let  it 
 simmer  gently  for  an  hour.  Take  away  the 
 bacon  that  surrounds  it,  and  strew  finely-grated 
 bread-crumbs  over  it.  This  dish  may  be  eaten 
 either  hot  or  cold.  If  eaten  hot,  a sauce  should 
 be  sent  to  table  with  it  made  of  the  bones  and
not  much  known  in  England,  except  in  the 
 western  counties,  where  they  are  principally 
 composed  of  suet,  flour,  &c.  Time,  twenty 
 minutes  to  boil.  Probable  cost,  6d.  Sufficient 
 for  ten  dumplings. 
  
 Marrow  Dumplings,  for  Soup.— 
  
 Cut  out  the  crumb  of  a light  roll,  and  soak 
 it  for  a minute  in  cold  milk.  Pour  off  the 
 milk,  and  add  two  ounces  of  flour,  half  a 
 pound  of  marrow,  chopped,  the  yolks  of  six 
 eggs,  beaten  to  a froth,  the  crumb  of  a small 
 roll  toasted,  and  cut  into  small  dice,  a table- 
 spoonful of  chopped  parsley,  and  pepper  and  salt 
 to  taste.  Stir  all  these  ingredients  well  together, 
 form  them  into  small  dumplings,  boil  them  in 
 weak  stock,  and  afterwards  add  them  to  the 
 soup.  Time  to  boil,  an  hour.  Probable  cost, 
 Is.  6d.  Sufficient  for  eight  persons.
 
 Marrow  Patties. — Prepare  as  for  Marrow 
 Toast.  Drop  into  boiling  water,  in  which 
 a little  salt  is  dissolved,  the  marrow  cut  into 
 small  pieces,  and  boil  for  one  minute.  Drain  it, 
 and  put  it  into  a saucepan  with  a tea-spoonful 
 of  parsley,  chopped,  a tiny  bit  of  shallot,  half  a 
 tea-spoonful  of  lemon-juice,  and  pepper  and 
 salt  to  taste.  Toss  these  ingredients  lightly 
 together  until  they  are  hot,  fill  the  patty-cases, 
 which  should  be  already  baked,  and  serve. 
 Time  to  prepare,  five  minutes. 
  
 Marrow  Pudding. — Place  in  a buttered 
 mould,  on  layers  of  a quarter  of  a pound  of 
 bread,  cut  in  thin  slices,  three  ounces  of  marrow, 
 chopped  fine,  an  ounce  of  citron,  cut  small,  and 
 two  ounces  of  poimded  sweet  almonds.  Cover 
 with  a sauce  made  of  half  a pint  of  milk  or 
 cream,  three  eggs,  well  beaten,  and  a sufficient
quantity  of  sugar  and  nutmeg  to  flavour  the 
 whole.  Boil  for  an  hour,  or  bake  for  forty 
 minutes,  turn  the  pudding  out  of  the  mould,  and 
 serve  with  a little  sifted  sugar  over  it.  The 
 almonds  may  be  left  out,  and  raisins  or  currants 
 substituted.  Probable  oost,  with  cream,  Is.  8d. 
 Sufficient  for  four  persons. 
  
 Marrow  Pudding,  Boiled  or  Baked. 
  
 — Pour  over  half  a pint  of  fine  crumbs,  prepared 
 from  stale  rolls,  three  breakfast-cupfuls  of  boil- 
 ing milk,  flavoured  with  lemon-peel  and  grated 
 nutmeg.  Cover  them  to  soak,  then  beat  to- 
 gether the  bread,  seven  ounces  of  carefully- 
 shred  marrow,  and  four  well-whisked  eggs. 
 Sweeten  to  taste,  and  boil  in  a buttered  mould, 
 or  bake  in  a dish  lined  with  puff  paste.  Time, 
 two  hours  to  boil ; an  hour  to  bake.  Sufficient 
 for  five  or  six  persons.
 
 Marrow  Pudding,  or  Pat  Pudding 
  
 (see  Fat  or  Marrow  Pudding). 
  
 Marrow  Sausages.— Beat  up  four  eggs 
 in  a basin,  leaving  out  one  white.  Add  to  them 
  
  
 six  ounces  of  captain’s  biscuit,  previously  soaked  ! 
 in  boiling  milk,  and  reduced  to  a pulp  through 
 a colander,  two  and  a half  ounces  of  almonds, 
 blanched  and  shred  small,  eight  ounces  of  mar- 
 row, some  powdered  cinnamon  and  nutmeg, 
 and  salt  and  sugar  to  taste.  Fill  ordinary  j 
 sausage-skins,  and  boil,  but  leave  space  in  the 
 skins  to  allow  of  swelling.  When  boiled,  lay  1 
 the  sausages  on  a sieve  to  cool,  and  when  re- 
 quired for  use,  brush  them  with  dissolved 
 butter,  and  heat  them  before  the  fire  or  in  a
French  beans,  boiled  in  the  usual  manner, 
 drained,  and  then  warmed  up  in  some  of  the 
 gravy,  may  be  laid  under  and  around  the  leg  of 
 mutton.  Probable  cost,  Is.  per  pound.  Sufficient 
 for  seven  or  eight  persons. 
  
 Mutton,  Leg  of,  with  Garlic. — The 
  
 peeuliar  pungent  taste  of  garlic  is  very  little 
 liked  by  the  English,  although  we  cannot  but 
 acknowledge  that  it  adds  to  the  variety  of 
 dishes  that  may  at  times  prove  acceptable. 
 The  following  treatment  will  considerably 
 soften  the  garlic’s  acridness  and  render  it  less 
 objectionable,  while  at  the  same  time  re- 
 taining its  characteristic  flavour.  Stuff  under 
 the  skin  of  a leg  of  mutton  near  the  shank 
 three  or  four  cloves  of  garlic  that  may  have 
 been  boiled  or  not,  according  to  taste,  the  water 
 having  been  changed  repeatedly  to  mellow
which  these  tubercles  somewhat  resemble.” 
  
 Silver- weed  ( Potcntilla  anserina). — The 
 roots  of  this  plant  are  frequently  eaten  in  Scot- 
 land, either  roasted  or  boiled.  They  taste  like 
 parsnips. 
  
 Solomon’s-Seal  ( Polygonatum  vulgare ). — The 
 young  shoots  are  boiled  and  eaten  as  greens. 
 The  roots  are  sometimes  dried,  ground,  and 
 made  into  bread. 
  
 Tree  Primrose,  or  German  Rampion 
 {(Enothera  biennis). — A native  of  Virginia, but 
 naturalised  in  some  parts  of  England.  When 
 the  plant  is  cultivated  like  the  carrot  or  parsnip 
 its  roots  are  crisp  and  sweet. 
  
 Viper’s  Grass,  or  Spanish  Salsify  ( Scor - 
 zonera  hispanica). — This  plant  was  once  be-
lieved to  be  an  antidote  to  the  bite  of  the  adder : 
 it  is  now  used  merely  as  a dietetic  plant.  The 
 roots  are  fleshy  and  not  unlike  carrots  and  par- 
 snips. When  boiled  their  flavour  is  very  like 
 that  of  asparagus. 
  
 Edible  Leguminous  Wild  Plants. 
  
 Sea-peas  ( Pisum  maritimum). — The  taste  of 
 the  sea-pea  is  bitter  and  disagreeable : when 
 more  pleasant  food  is  to  be  had  it  is  therefore 
 let  alone.  In  1555,  however,  when  there  was  a 
 great  famine  in  England,  the  seeds  of  the  sea- 
 pea  were  employed  as  food,  and  by  this  means 
 thousands  of  lives  were  saved. 
  
 Wild  Vetches  {Lathy r a,  Vicia , and  Frvum). 
 The  seeds  of  all  the  British  species  of  these 
 , genera  may  be  employed  as  peas.  They  are 
 met  with  in  hedges,  woods,  and  cornfields,  and
and  the  root  is  much  employed  by  the  poor  in 
 some  continental  districts  as  a substitute  for 
 coffee.  The  young  roots  and  also  the  blanched 
 leaves,  which  considerably  resemble  those  of 
 endive,  are  sometimes  eaten  in  France  with 
 thin  slices  of  bread  and  butter. 
  
 Ox-eye  Daisy  {Chrysanthemum  leucanthe- 
 mum) . — A perennial  plant  common  in  dry 
 pastures. 
  
 Salad  Burnet  {Poterium  Sanguisorba). — The 
  
  
 leaves  of  the  salad  burnet  smell  and  taste  just 
 like  cucumber. 
  
 Sea  Bindweed  {Convolvulus soldanella). — This 
 plant  is  plentiful  on  the  sea-coasts,  where  the 
 natives  gather  the  tender  stalks  and  pickle  them.
 
 Stonecrop,  or  Orpine  {Sedum  telepliium). — 
 The  leaves  of  the  stonecrop  are  eaten  in  salads 
 like  those  of  purslane,  to  which  the  French  hold 
 it  to  be  equal. 
  
 Sweet  Cicely  {Scandix  odorata). — The  leaves 
 of  this  plant  used  to  be  employed  like  those  of 
 the  chervil.  The  green  seeds  ground  small  and 
 used  with  lettuce  and  other  cold  salads  impart  to 
 them  a warm  agreeable  taste. 
  
 Wild  Plants  furnishing  a Substitute  for 
 Tea. 
  
 Speedwell  {Veronica  spicata). — This  is  occa- 
 sionally employed  as  a substitute  for  tea : it  is 
 said  to  have  an  astringent  taste  like  green  tea. 
  
 Spring  Grass  {Anthoxanthum  odoratum). — A
decoction  of  this  highly  odoriferous  grass  is  said 
 strongly  to  resemble  tea. 
  
 Black-currant  leaves  also  furnish  a very  good 
 substitute  for  green  tea,  and  those  of  Saxifraga 
 crassifolia  are  reported  to  be  used  as  tea  in 
 Siberia.  Betonica  officinalis  is  held  by  some  to 
 have  the  taste  and  all  the  good  qualities  of 
 foreign  tea  without  the  bad  ones. 
  
 Miscellaneous  Edible  Wild  Plants. 
  
 Butterworth  {Pinguicula  vulgaris). — In  Lap- 
 land  and  the  north  of  Sweden  the  inhabitants 
 pour  milk  warm  from  the  cow  on  this  plant, 
 thus  giving  it  the  consistency  of  cream.  They 
 then  strain  it  immediately,  and  lay  it  aside  for 
 two  or  three  days  till  it  acquires  a degree  of 
 acidity.  ‘ ‘ This  milk  they  are  extremely  fond 
 of;  and  once  made  they  need -not  repeat  the
spoonful of  pounded  loaf  sugar.  Make  the 
 broth  boiling  hot,  and  pour  it  into  the  soup 
 tureen  over  small  slices  of  toasted  bread, 
 adding,  according  to  taste,  a portion  of  the 
 vegetables  cut  into  thin  slices.  Itemove  the 
 tape  or  string,  and  serve  the  meat,  garnishing 
 with  mashed  potatoes,  spinach,  or  other  vege- 
 tables in  season.  Do  not  be  too  liberal  in  the 
 use  of  pepper  and  salt;  these  can  be  added 
 according  to  taste  after  the  soup  is  ready. 
  
 Pot-au-Feu,  French,  Analysis  of 
 the. — In  the  housekeeping  of  the  French 
 artisan  the  broth-pot  yields  the  most  substan- 
 tial nourishment;  the  wife  attending  to  it, 
 yet  without  possessing  the  slightest  notion  of 
 chemistry ; she  places  the  meat  in  the  pot,  with 
 about  two  quarts  of  water  to  three  pounds  of 
 beef,  at  the  corner  of  the  fire,  where,  slowly 
 becoming . hot,  the  heat  swells  the  muscular
Buff  or  Pope. — This  fish  spawns  in  April, 
 and  is  in  season  all  the  year.  Its  excellence  as 
 a fish  for  the  table  excited  the  enthusiasm  of  Dr. 
 Kitchiner.  The  ruff  is  thus  alluded  to  in  Izaac 
 Walton’s  famous  “ Complete  Angler”: — “There 
 is  also  another  fish  called  a pope,  and  by  some 
 a ruff,  a fish  that  is  not  known  to  be  in  some 
 rivers.  lie  is  much  like  the  perch  for  his  shape, 
 and  taken  to  be  better  than  the  perch,  hut  will 
 not  grow  to  be  bigger  than  a gudgeon ; he  is 
 an  excellent  fish ; no  fish  that  swims  is  of  a 
 pleasanter  taste,  and  he  is  also  excellent  to 
 enter  a young  angler,  for  he  is  a greedy  biter, 
 and  they  will  usually  lie  abundance  of  them 
 together,  in  one  reserved  place  where  the  water 
 is  deep  and  runs  quietly ; and  an  easy  angler, 
  
  
 RUG 
 
Rum. — This  well-known  and  much  esteemed 
 spirituous  liquor  is  imported  into  this  country 
 from  the  West  Indies,  of  which  it  is  one  of  the 
 staple  products.  It  is  obtained  by  means  of 
 fermentation  and  distillation  from  molasses,  the 
 refuse  of  the  cane-juice,  and  portions  of  the 
 cane,  after  the  sugar  has  been  extracted.  The 
 flavour  and  taste  peculiar  to  rum  are  derived 
 from  the  essential  oils  carried  over  in  distil- 
 lation. When  the  distillation  has  been  care- 
 lessly performed,  the  spirit  contains  so  large  a 
 quantity  of  the  grosser  and  less  volatile  part  of 
 the  oil  as  to  be  unfit  for  use  till  it  has  attained 
 a considerable  age.  When  it  is  well  rectified 
 it  mellows  much  sooner.  Rum  of  a brownish 
 transparent  colour,  smooth  oily  taste,  strong- 
 body  and  consistence,  good  age,  and  well  kept, 
 is  the  best.  That  which  is  clear  and  limpid, 
 and  has  a hot  pungent  taste,  is  either  too  new 
 or  mixed  with  other  spirits.  Jamaica  rum  is
to  prepare,  about  one  hour.  Probable  cost,  if 
 made  with  milk,  Is.  8d.,  exclusive  of  the  rum. 
 Sufficient  for  a quart  mould. 
  
 Rum  Cake. — Take  the  yolks  of  twelve 
 eggs,  beat  them  up,  and  add  three-quarters  of  a 
 pint  of  cream,  the  same  quantity  of  rum,  and 
 sugar  to  taste ; add  also  the  grated  peel  of  a 
 lemon.  Butter  a form,  pour  the  mixture  in, 
 and  bake  it  till  it  is  dry  at  the  top ; the  cake 
 may  be  iced  or  only  strewn  with  sifted  sugar, 
 and  ornamented  with  preserved  cherries,  &c.,or 
 whipped  cream  may  be  laid  on  the  top. 
  
 Rum  Ice. — Rub  the  rind  of  a large  fresli 
 lemon  upon  three  or  four  lumps  of  sugar  till  all 
 the  yellow  part  is  taken  off,  and  add  as  much 
 sugar  as  will  make  up  the  weight  to  three- 
 quarters  of  a pound.  Put  this  into  a saucepan 
 with  a pint  of  cold  water  and  a table-spoonful
well,  is  wholesome,  and  economical  also.  The 
 black  bread  of  Germany  and  other  parts  of 
 Europe  is  composed  of  rye  only  ground  into 
 coarse  meal,  and  fermented  often  by  means  of 
 leaven  (or  dough  left  from  a previous  baking 
 and  become  slightly  sour),  which  is  an  un- 
 favourable mode  of  fabricating  it,  because  rye 
 has  a tendency  to  pass  quickly  into  what  is 
 termed  the  acetous  state  of  fermentation,  and 
 requires  to  be  carefully  watched  and  skilfully 
 managed  to  prevent  the  bread  made  of  it  from 
 acquiring  an  acid  taste.  When  the  flour  of 
 rye  is  mixed  with  half  or  two-thirds  as  much 
 of  wheat-flour,  the  dough  may  be  prepared  in 
 the  ordinary  manner,  rather  less  time  in  warm 
 weather  being  allowed  for  its  rising.” 
  
 Rye-bread  in  Holland.— In  Holland 
 two  sorts  of  rye-bread  are  eaten,  the  one  hand- 
 made, the  other  manufactured  by  machinery.
The  latter  is  preferred  by  the  wealthier  classes  : 
 it  is  of  a dark  colour,  and  has  an  odour  not  unlike 
 gingerbread.  The  working  classes,  on  the  other 
 hand,  like  hand-made  rye-bread  best,  because  it 
 is  whiter — a popular  taste  which  finds  its  coun- 
 terpart in  this  country.  There  is  no  real  dif- 
 ference in  the  quality  of  the  rye,  but  there  is 
 in  the  baking,  the  hand-made  bread  being  left 
 in  the  oven  for  twenty-four  hours,  while  the 
 machine-made  is  left  for  twice  that  time. 
  
 Rye  Drop  Cakes. — Mix  together  a quart 
 of  milk,  two  eggs  well  beaten,  a piece  of  butter 
 as  large  as  an  egg,  one  tea-spoonful  of  soda, 
 two  tea-spoonfuls  of  cream  of  tartar,  half  a 
 cupful  of  white  sugar,  and  enough  rye-meal  to 
 make  a thick  batter.  Bake  for  half  an  hour. 
  
 Rye-meal  Mush  (an  American  recipe). — 
 Stir  fresh-ground  rye  gradually  into  boiling
dens from  Holland,  where  it  grows  very  plenti- 
 fully. The  leaves  of  this  plant  are  exceedingly 
 pungent,  therefore  the  best  way  of  eating  them 
 is  between  bread  and  butter,  as  by  this  means 
 they  are  rendered  less  offensive  to  the  palate, 
 and  their  whole  virtues,  which  are  very  con- 
 siderable, are  taken  into  the  stomach. 
  
 Sea  Bass. — Bass  is  a name  given  to  several 
 kinds  of  fish,  all  of  which  are  excellent  for 
 food.  Sometimes  a kind  of  perch  is  thus  named. 
 In  North  America  the  name  denotes  a striped 
 fish  of  good  size,  and  which  often  weighs  as 
 much  as  fifteen  pounds ; while  the  sea  bass  is  a 
  
  
 striped  fish  with  a large  head,  which  grows  to 
 two  or  three  pounds  weight,  and  which  is  never 
 found  in  fresh  water.  All  these  varieties  taste 
 well,  and  may  either  be  boiled  or  fried  like
often  gather  the  young  shoots,  and  pickle  them 
 in  the  same  way  as  samphire.  Before  being 
 pickled  they  have  a salt,  bitterish  taste. 
  
 Sea  Bream. — This  fish,  which  grows  to 
 the  length  of  sixteen  to  twenty  inches,  though 
 handsome  in  appearance,  is  not  very  highly 
 esteemed.  It  is  best  when  boiled.  ( See  Bream.) 
  
  
 SEA  BREAM. 
  
  
 Sea  Dragon  ( Vives ). — The  sea  dragon  is  a 
 fish  seldom  eaten  in  England,  but  in  France  it 
 is  often  sent  to  table.  It  is  broiled,  and  served 
 up  with  butter  of  anchovies,  maitre  d’hotel 
 sauce,  or  provenqale  sauce.  Towards  the  gills, 
 it  should  be  observed,  there  is  a venomous 
 bone.
 
 Sea  Holly. — This  is  a plant  found  upon 
 the  sea  coasts  of  many  parts  of  England.  It  is 
 a perennial,  with  a long,  tough,  creeping  root, 
 which  sends  forth  several  roundish,  bluish 
 prickly  leaves,  standing  on  long  footstalks,  and 
 mostly  lodged  on  the  ground.  The  roots  have 
 a pleasant,  sweetish  taste,  mixed  with  a slight 
 degree  of  warmth  and  acrimony.  They  are 
 candied  and  eaten  for  disorders  of  the  lungs.

so  delicate.  Unblanched  it  is  worthless.  Per- 
 sons ignorant  of  the  proper  mode  of  doing 
 this  by  earthing  up  the  plants  and  covering 
 them  with  pots,  when  they  came  into  pos- 
 session of  gardens  where  it  had  been  planted, 
 have  been  known  to  root  it  up,  and  throw  it 
 away,  because  they  tasted  only  its  full-grown 
 leaves,  and  found  them  unpalatable.  It  is  the 
 action  of  light  which  imparts  its  strong  and 
 bitter  taste  to  sea  kale,  as  well  as  its  glaucous- 
 green  and  reddish-purple  colouring.  Conse- 
 quently, sea  kale  after  it  is  cut  should  be 
 kept  in  a dark  place  till  wanted.  If  exposed  in 
 an  open  situation,  it  will  in  two  or  three  days 
 acquire  a decided  tinge,  which  injures  both  its 
 appearance  and  flavour.  Sea  kale  is  amongst 
 the  earliest  of  vegetables.  It  may  frequently 
 be  procured  in  January,  and  is  in  full  season 
 from  February  to  June. 
 
remains  colourless;  otherwise  it  will  impart  a 
 bitter  taste  to  the  toast.  Time — the  better  the 
 kale  is,  the  quicker  it  will  be  done ; if  young  and 
 fresh,  it  will  he  done  enough  in  from  twenty  to 
 thirty  minutes  ; if  stale  and  discoloured,  it  will 
 need  from  forty  to  fifty  minutes.  If  there  is 
 any  suspicion  that  the  kale  is  stale,  the  water 
 should  be  poured  off  when  it  is  half  done,  and 
 fresh  water  substituted.  Probable  cost  when 
 plentiful,  lOd.  to  Is.  per  basket.  Sufficient, 
 twelve  heads  for  three  or  four  persons. 
  
 Sea  Kale,  Choosing  of.  — Sea  kale 
 should  be  dressed  as  soon  as  possible  after  it  is 
 cut.  When  fresh,  it  is  white  in  colour  and 
 crisp.  If  it  has  acquired  a dark  tinge,  and  is 
 limp  to  the  touch,  it  is  stale  and  comparatively 
 worthless.  After  it  is  purchased  it  should 
 he  kept  covered  up,  and  in  a dark  place,  till 
 wanted.
at  a meeting  in  1871  of  the  Academy  of  Sciences 
 at  Paris  that  while  excellent  bread  can  be  made 
 with  sea-water,  forming,  by  the  way,  a good 
 tonic,  soup  or  broth  made  with  sea- water  is 
 entirely  uneatable.  It  would  appear  that  the 
 chloride  of  magnesium  in  the  sea- water  is  raised

 to  a temperature,  during  the  process  of  baking, 
 sufficiently  high  to  effect  its  destruction,  and 
 thereby  cause  its  peculiar  taste  to  disappear,
which  is  not  the  case  when  merely  boiled,  as 
 for  soup.  If,  however,  cane  sugar  be  added  to 
 the  soup,  a compound  is  said  to  be  formed  of 
 the  sugar  with  the  chlorides,  which  has  not  the 
 disagreeable  taste  of  the  latter. 
  
 Seaweeds  used  as  Articles  of  Diet. 
  
 — Amongst  seaweeds,  which  have  been  used  as 
 articles  of  diet,  none  is  better  known  than  the 
 Chrondrus  crispus,  which,  under  the  name  of 
 carrageen  moss,  Irish  moss,  and  pearl  moss,  has 
 been  long  eaten  in  Europe.  It  is  recommended 
 as  a medicine,  but  it  has  no  bitter  principle, 
 and  probably  is  less  tonic  than  the  lichen.  Sea- 
 weeds have  occasionally  been  resorted  to  by  the 
 poorer  inhabitants  of  the  seashores  of  Europe, 
 more  especially  in  Ireland,  when  the  ordinary 
 com  or  potato  crop  has  failed.  They,  however, 
 contain  but  little  nutriment,  and  any  one  living-
flesh  forms  their  most  usual  food ; its  fat  is 
 partly  dressed  for  eating,  and  partly  consumed 
 in  then-  lamps  ; the  liver  when  fried  is  esteemed, 
 even  among  sailors,  as  an  agreeable  dish. 
  
 Seasoning. — The  art  of  seasoning  dishes 
 can  only  be  acquired  by  experience.  Accurate 
 directions  cannot  possibly  be  given,  because 
 tastes  differ  so  widely,  and  that  which  is 
 agreeable  to  one  may  be  insipid  to  another, 
 and  too  highly  seasoned  for  a third.  A cook 
 should  endeavour  to  ascertain  the  taste  of  those 
 she  serves,  and  should  adapt  the  seasoning  to 
 meet  their  requirements.  She  should  add  the 
 seasoning  in  small  quantities,  as  she  can  easily 
 put  in  more  if  needed,  but  cannot  remove  what 
 is  already  there. 
  
 All  solid  ingredients — as  herbs,  spices,  and 
 vegetables — need  the  action  of  heat  to  bring
flavours,  and  there  is  scarcely  any  mixture 
 sweet  or  savoury  which  will  not  be  improved 
 by  the  addition  of  a little  salt.  Extravagantly- 
 used  it  will  overpower  every  other  flavour,  and 
 entirely  spoil  a dish.  A soup  or  stew  should 
 be  slightly  salted  at  first.  It  should  be  salted 
 to  a certain  extent  to  remove  a raw  taste  which 
 would  otherwise  be  found;  and  it  should  not  be 
 sufficiently  salted,  because  as  the  liquor  boils 
 away  the  salt  flavour  will  increase. 
  
 Generally  speaking,  it  will  be  conceded  that 
 herbs  impart  a more  delicate  flavour  than 
 spices,  and  also  that  old  vegetables  impart  a 
 stronger  flavour  than  young  ones.  Whatever 
 flavourings  are  used  they  should  not  be  per- 
 mitted to  overpower  the  taste  of  the  article 
 which  forms  the  basis  of  a dish.  Ketchups 
 and  store  sauces  should  be  sparingly  adminis- 
 tered, as  also  should  be  cayenne  pepper,  and
Shrimps  and  Prawns,  Choosing  of. 
  
 — These  fish,  when  in  perfection,  afford  a 
 pleasant  scent,  are  very  firm,  and  their  tails 
 turn  stiffly  inwards.  They  have  a bright 
 colour,  when  fresh ; but  their  tails  grow  limp, 
 the  brightness  of  their  colour  goes  off,  and  they 
 become  pale  and  clammy,  when  stale. 
  
 Shrimps,  Boiled.— Shrimps  under-boiled 
 are  very  indigestible ; over-boiled  they  are  taste- 
 less and  unwholesome.  The  time  which  they 
 take  to  boil  depends  upon  the  size.  When  they 
 change  colour,  taste  them,  in  order  to  ascertain 
 whether  or  not  they  are  sufficiently  dressed. 
 Shrimps  are  generally  boiled  in  plain  salt  and 
 water.  ■ M.  Soyer  recommends  that  a sprig  of 
 lemon  thyme,  a sprig  of  mint,  and  a bay-leaf 
 should  be  boiled  with  them  ; this  is  a matter 
 of  taste.  Put  from  five  to  six  ounces  of  salt  in
