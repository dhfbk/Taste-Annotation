Composition of certain _Crude_ and fresh Herbs, such as usually are, 
 or may safely be eaten with some _Acetous_ Juice, _Oyl, Salt_, &c. to 
 give them a grateful Gust and _Vehicle_; exclusive of the [8][Greek: 
 psuchrai trapezai], eaten without their due Correctives, which the 
 Learned [9]_Salmasius_, and, indeed generally, the [10]old _Physicians_ 
 affirm (and that truly) all _Crude_ and raw [Greek: lachana] require 
 to render them wholsome; so as probably they were from hence, as 
 [11]_Pliny_ thinks, call  '  d _Acetaria_: and not (as _Hermolaus_ and 
 some others) _Acceptaria ab Accipiendo_; nor from Accedere, though so 
 [12]ready at hand, and easily dress  '  d; requiring neither _Fire, Cost_, 
 or _Attendance_, to boil, roast, and prepare them as did Flesh, and 
 other Provisions; from which, and other Prerogatives, they were always 
 in use, _&c._ And hence indeed the more frugal _Italians_ and _French_, 
 to this Day, gather _Ogni Verdura_, any thing almost that  '  s _Green_ 
 and Tender, to the very Tops of _Nettles_; so as every Hedge affords 
 a _Sallet_ (not unagreeable) season  '  d with its proper _Oxybaphon_ of 
 _Vinegar, Salt, Oyl_, &c. which doubtless gives it both the Relish 
 and Name of _Salad, Emsalada_[13], as with us of _Sallet_; from the 
 _Sapidity_, which renders not _Plants_ and _Herbs_ alone, but _Men_ 
 themselves, and their Conversations, pleasant and agreeable: But of
_Sparagus_, or sodden in Pottage: There is both a white and red, much 
 us  '  d in _Spain_ and _Italy_; but besides its humidity and detersive 
 Nature,   '  tis _Insipid_ enough. 
  
  
 7. Borrage, _Borrago_ (_Gaudia semper ago_) hot and kindly moist, 
 purifying the Blood, is an exhilarating Cordial, of a pleasant Flavour: 
 The tender Leaves, and Flowers especially, may be eaten in Composition; 
 but above all, the Sprigs in _Wine_, like those of _Baum_, are of known 
 Vertue to revive the _Hypochondriac_, and chear the hard Student. See 
 _Bugloss_. 
  
  
 8. Brooklime, _Anagallis aquatica_; moderately hot and moist, prevalent 
 in the _Scorbute_, and _Stone_. 
  
  
 9. Bugloss, _Buglossum_; in mature much like _Borrage_, yet something 
 more astringent. The Flowers of both, with the intire Plant, greatly 
 restorative, being Conserv  '  d: And for the rest, so much commended by
20. Cucumber, _Cucumis_; tho  '   very cold and moist, the most approved 
 _Sallet_ alone, or in Composition, of all the _Vinaigrets_, to sharpen 
 the Appetite, and cool the Liver, [16]_&c._ if rightly prepar  '  d; that 
 is, by rectifying the vulgar Mistake of altogether extracting the Juice, 
 in which it should rather be soak  '  d: Nor ought it to be over _Oyl  '  d_, 
 too much abating of its grateful _Acidity_, and _palling_ the Taste from 
 a contrariety of Particles: Let them therefore be pared, and cut in 
 thin Slices, with a _Clove_ or two of _Onion_ to correct the Crudity, 
 macerated in the Juice, often turn  '  d and moderately drain  '  d. Others 
 prepare them, by shaking the Slices between two Dishes, and dress them 
 with very little _Oyl_, well beaten, and mingled with the Juice of 
 _Limon, Orange_, or _Vinegar, Salt_ and _Pepper_. Some again, (and 
 indeed the most approv  '  d) eat them as soon as they are cut, retaining 
 their Liquor, which being exhausted (by the former Method) have nothing 
 remaining in them to help the Concoction. Of old they [17]boil  '  d the 
 _Cucumber_, and paring off the Rind, eat them with _Oyl, Vinegar_, and 
 _Honey_; _Sugar_ not being so well known. Lastly, the _Pulp_ in Broth is 
 greatly refreshing, and may be mingl  '  d in most _Sallets_, without the 
 least damage, contrary to the common Opinion; it not being long, since 
 _Cucumber_, however dress  '  d, was thought fit to be thrown away, being
accounted little better than Poyson. _Tavernier_ tells us, that in 
 the _Levant_, if a Child cry for something to Eat, they give it a 
 raw _Cucumber_ instead of _Bread_. The young ones may be boil  '  d in 
 White-Wine. The smaller sort (known by the name of _Gerckems_) muriated 
 with the Seeds of _Dill_, and the _Mango_ Pickle are for the Winter. 
  
  
 21. Daisy, _Buphthalmum_, Ox-Eye, or _Bellis-major_: The young _Roots_ 
 are frequently eaten by the _Spaniards_ and _Italians_ all the Spring 
 till _June_. 
  
  
 22. Dandelion, _Dens Leonis, Condrilla_: Macerated in several Waters, 
 to extract the bitterness; tho  '   somewhat opening, is very wholsome, and 
 little inferior to _Succory, Endive_, &c. The _French_ Country-People 
 eat the Roots; and   '  twas with this homely _Sallet_, the Good-Wife 
 _Hecate_ entertain  '  d _Theseus_. See _Sowthistle_. 
  
  
 23. Dock, _Oxylapathum_, or sharp-pointed Dock: Emollient, and tho  ' 
otherwise not for our _Sallet_, the _Roots_ brewed in _Ale_ or _Beer_, 
 are excellent for the _Scorbute_. 
  
  
 Earth-Nuts, _Bulbo-Castanum_; (found in divers places of _Surry_, near 
 _Kingston_, and other parts) the Rind par  '  d off, are eaten crude by 
 Rustics, with a little _Pepper_; but are best boil  '  d like other Roots, 
 or in Pottage rather, and are sweet and nourishing. 
  
  
 24. Elder, _Sambucus_; The Flowers infus  '  d in _Vinegar_, grateful both 
 to the Stomach and Taste; attenuate thick and viscid Humours; and tho  '  
 the Leaves are somewhat rank of Smell, and so not commendable in 
 _Sallet_; they are otherwise (as indeed is the intire Shrub) of the most 
 sovereign Vertue; and the spring Buds and tender Leaves, excellently 
 wholsome in Pottage at that Season of the Year. See _Flowers_. 
  
  
 25. Endive, _Endivium, Intubum Sativum_; the largest, whitest, and 
 tenderest Leaves best boil  '  d, and less crude. It is naturally Cold,
profitable for hot Stomachs; _Incisive_ and opening Obstructions 
 of the Liver: The curled is more delicate, being eaten alone, or in 
 Composition, with the usual _Intinctus_: It is also excellent being 
 boil  '  d; the middle part of the Blanch  '  d-Stalk separated, eats firm, and 
 the ampler Leaves by many perferr  '  d before _Lettuce_. See _Succory_. 
  
  
 Eschalot. See _Onions_. 
  
  
 26. Fennel, _Foeniculum_: The sweetest of _Bolognia_: Aromatick, 
 hot, and dry; expels Wind, sharpens the Sight, and recreates the Brain; 
 especially the tender _Umbella_ and Seed-Pods. The Stalks are to be 
 peel  '  d when young, and then dress  '  d like _Sellery_. The tender Tufts and 
 Leaves emerging, being minc  '  d, are eaten alone with _Vinegar_, or _Oyl_, 
 and _Pepper_, and to correct the colder Materials, enter properly into 
 Composition. The _Italians_ eat the blanch  '  d Stalk (which they call 
 _Cartucci_) all Winter long. There is a very small _Green-Worm_, which 
 sometimes lodges in the Stemm of this Plant, which is to be taken out, 
 as the _Red_ one in that of _Sellery_.
 
  
 27. Flowers, _Flores_; chiefly of the _Aromatick Esculents_ and 
 Plants are preferrable, as generally endow  '  d with the Vertues of their 
 _Simples_, in a more intense degree; and may therefore be eaten alone 
 in their proper _Vehicles_, or Composition with other _Salleting_, 
 sprinkl  '  d among them; But give a more palatable Relish, being Infus  '  d 
 in _Vinegar_; Especially those of the _Clove-Gillyflower, Elder, Orange, 
 Cowslip, Rosemary, Arch-Angel, Sage, Nasturtium Indicum_, &c. Some of 
 them are Pickl  '  d, and divers of them make also very pleasant and wholsome 
 _Theas_, as do likewise the Wild _Time, Bugloss, Mint_, &c. 
  
  
 28. Garlick, _Allium_; dry towards Excess; and tho  '   both by _Spaniards_ 
 and _Italians_, and the more Southern People, familiarly eaten, with 
 almost every thing, and esteem  '  d of such sigular Vertue to help 
 Conception, and thought a Charm against all Infection and Poyson (by 
 which it has obtain  '  d the Name of the _Country-man  '  s Theriacle_) we yet 
 think it more proper for our Northern Rustics, especially living in 
 _Uliginous_ and moist places, or such as use the _Sea_: Whilst we
and other _Omphacia_, and therefore never to be excluded. Vide 
 _Wood-Sorrel_. 
  
  
 62. Sow-thistle, _Sonchus_; of the _Intybus_-kind. _Galen_ was us  '  d 
 to eat it as _Lettuce_; exceedingly welcome to the late _Morocco._ 
 Ambassador and his Retinue. 
  
  
 63. Sparagus, _Asparagus_ (_ab Asperitate_) temperately hot, and moist; 
 _Cordial_, _Diuretic_, easie of Digestion, and next to _Flesh_, nothing 
 more nourishing, as _Sim. Sethius_, an excellent Physician holds. They 
 are sometimes, but very seldom, eaten raw with _Oyl_, and _Vinegar_; but 
 with more delicacy (the bitterness first exhausted) being so speedily 
 boil  '  d, as not to lose the _verdure_ and agreeable tenderness; which is 
 done by letting the Water boil, before you put them in. I do not esteem 
 the _Dutch_ great and larger sort (especially rais  '  d by the rankness of 
 the Beds) so sweet and agreeable, as those of a moderate size. 
  
 
64. Spinach, _Spinachia_: of old not us  '  d in _Sallets_, and the oftner 
 kept out the better; I speak of the _crude_: But being boil  '  d to a 
 _Pult_, and without other Water than its own moisture, is a most 
 excellent Condiment with _Butter_, _Vinegar_, or _Limon_, for almost 
 all sorts of boil  '  d Flesh, and may accompany a Sick Man  '  s Diet.   '  Tis 
 _Laxative_ and _Emollient_, and therefore profitable for the Aged, and 
 (tho  '   by original a _Spaniard_) may be had at almost any Season, and 
 in all places. 
  
  
 Stone-Crop, _Sedum Minus_. See _Trick-Madame_. 
  
  
 65. Succory, _Cichorium_, an _Intube_; erratic and wild, with a narrow 
 dark Leaf, different from the _Sative_, tho  '   probably by culture only; 
 and for being very bitter, a little _edulcorated_ with _Sugar_ and 
 _Vinegar_, is by some eaten in the Summer, and more grateful to the 
 Stomach than the Palate. See _Endive_. 
  
 
66. Tansy, _Tanacetum_; hot and cleansing; but in regard of its 
 domineering relish, sparingly mixt with our cold _Sallet_, and much 
 fitter (tho  '   in very small quantity) for the Pan, being qualified with 
 the Juices of other fresh Herbs, _Spinach_, _Green Corn_, _Violet_, 
 _Primrose-Leaves_, &c. at entrance of the Spring, and then fried 
 brownish, is eaten hot with the Juice of _Orange_ and _Sugar_, as one 
 of the most agreeable of all the boil  '  d _Herbaceous_ Dishes. 
  
  
 67. Tarragon, _Draco Herba_, of _Spanish_ Extraction; hot and spicy: The 
 Tops and young Shoots, like those of _Rochet_, never to be secluded our 
 Composition, especially where there is much _Lettuce_.   '  Tis highly 
 cordial and friendly to the Head, Heart, Liver, correcting the weakness 
 of the Ventricle, _&c._ 
  
  
 68. Thistle, _Carduus Mariæ_; our Lady  '  s milky or dappl  '  d Thistle, 
 disarm  '  d of its Prickles, is worth esteem: The young Stalk about _May_, 
 being peel  '  d and soak  '  d in Water, to extract the bitterness, boil  '  d or 
 raw, is a very wholsome _Sallet_, eaten with _Oyl_, _Salt_, and _Peper_;
some eat them sodden in proper Broath, or bak  '  d in Pies, like the 
 _Artichoak_; but the tender Stalk boil  '  d or fry  '  d, some preferr; both 
 Nourishing and Restorative. 
  
  
 69. Trick-Madame, _Sedum minus_, Stone-Crop; is cooling and moist, 
 grateful to the Stomach. The _Cimata_ and Tops, when young and tender, 
 dress  '  d as _Purselane_, is a frequent Ingredient in our cold _Sallet_. 
  
  
 70. Turnep, _Rapum_; moderately hot and moist: _Napus_; the long _Navet_ 
 is certainly the most delicate of them, and best Nourishing. _Pliny_ 
 speaks of no fewer than six sorts, and of several Colours; some of which 
 were suspected to be artificially tinged. But with us, the yellow is 
 preferr  '  d; by others the red _Bohemian_. But of whatever kind, being 
 sown upon the _Hot-bed_, and no bigger than seedling _Radish_, they do 
 excellently in Composition; as do also the Stalks of the common 
 _Turnep_, when first beginning to Bud. 
  
 And here should not be forgotten, that wholsome, as well as agreeable
sort of _Bread_, we are [42]taught to make; and of which we have eaten 
 at the greatest Persons Tables, hardly to be distinguish  '  d from the best 
 of _Wheat_. 
  
 Let the _Turneps_ first be peel  '  d, and boil  '  d in Water till soft and 
 tender; then strongly pressing out the Juice, mix them together, and 
 when dry (beaten or pounded very fine) with their weight of Wheat-Meal, 
 season it as you do other _Bread_, and knead it up; then letting the 
 Dough remain a little to _ferment_, fashion the Paste into Loaves, and 
 bake it like common Bread. 
  
 Some roast _Turneps_ in a Paper under the Embers, and eat them with 
 _Sugar_ and _Butter_. 
  
  
 71. Vine, _Vitis_, the _Capreols_, _Tendrels_, and _Claspers_ (like 
 those of the _Hop_, &c.) whilst very young, have an agreeable _Acid_, 
 which may be eaten alone, or with other _Sallet_. 
  
 
72. Viper-grass, _Tragopogon_, _Scorzonera_, _Salsifex_, &c. tho  '  
 Medicinal, and excellent against the _Palpitation of the Heart_, 
 _Faintings_, _Obstruction of the Bowels_, &c. are besides a very sweet 
 and pleasant _Sallet_; being laid to soak out the bitterness, then 
 peel  '  d, may be eaten raw, or _Condited_; but best of all stew  '  d with 
 _Marrow_, _Spice_, _Wine_, &c. as _Artichoak_, _Skirrets_, &c. sliced or 
 whole. They likewise may bake, fry, or boil them; a more excellent Root 
 there is hardly growing. 
  
  
 73. Wood-Sorrel, _Trifolium acetosum_, or _Alleluja_, of the nature of 
 other _Sorrels_. 
  
  
 To all which might we add sundry more, formerly had in _deliciis_, 
 since grown _obsolete_ or quite neglected with us: As among the noblest 
 _Bulbs_, that of the _Tulip_; a Root of which has been valued not to 
 eat, but for the _Flower_ (and yet eaten by mistake) at more than an 
 hundred Pounds. The young fresh _Bulbs_ are sweet and high of taste. 
 
and strong constitutions? bessides the hazard of being mistaken in the 
 Names of divers _Simples_, not as yet fully agreed upon among the 
 Learned in _Botany_. 
  
 There are bessides several remaining, which tho  '   _Abdicated_ here 
 with us, find Entertainment still in Foreign Countries: As the large 
 _Heliotrope_ and Sun-flower (e  '  re it comes to expand, and shew its 
 golden Face) which being dress  '  d as the _Artichoak_, is eaten for a 
 dainty. This I add as a new Discovery. I once made _Macaroons_ with the 
 ripe blanch  '  d Seeds, but the _Turpentine_ did so domineer over all, that 
 it did not answer expectation. The _Radix Personata_ mounting with their 
 young Heads, _Lysimachia siliquosa glabra minor_, when fresh and tender, 
 begins to come into the _Sallet_-Tribe. The pale whiter _Popy_, is eaten 
 by the _Genouese_. By the _Spaniards_, the tops of _Wormwood_ with _Oyl_ 
 alone, and without so much as _Bread_; profitable indeed to the Stomach, 
 but offensive to the Head; As is also _Coriander_ and _Rue_, which 
 _Galen_ was accustom  '  d to eat raw, and by it self, with _Oyl_ and 
 _Salt_, as exceedingly grateful, as well as wholsome, and of great 
 vertue against Infection. _Pliny_, I remember, reports it to be of such 
 effect for the Preservation of _Sight_; that the _Painters_ of his Time,
us  '  d to devour a great quantity of it. And it is still by the _Italians_ 
 frequently mingled among their _Sallets_. The _Lapatha Personata_ 
 (common _Burdock_) comes now and then to the best Tables, about _April_, 
 and when young, before the _Burrs_ and _Clots_ appear, being strip  '  d, 
 and the bitterness soaked out, treated as the _Chardoon_, is eaten in 
 _Poiverade_; Some also boil them. More might here be reckon  '  d up, but 
 these may suffice; since as we find some are left off, and gone out, so 
 others be introduc  '  d and come in their room, and that in much greater 
 Plenty and Variety, than was ever known by our Ancestors. The _Cucumber_ 
 it self, now so universally eaten, being accounted little better than 
 _Poyson_, even within our Memory, as already noted. 
  
 To conclude, and after all that has been said of Plants and _Salleting_, 
 formerly in great esteem, (but since obsolete and quite rejected); What 
 if the exalted Juice of the ancient _Silphium_ should come in, and 
 challenge the Precedency? It is a [43]Plant formerly so highly priz  '  d, 
 and rare for the richness of its Taste and other Vertues; that as it was 
 dedicated to _Apollo_, and hung up in his Temple at _Delphi_; So we read 
 of one single Root brought to the Emperor _Nero_ for an extraordinary 
 Present; and the Drug so esteem  '  d, that the _Romans_ had long before
and _herbaceous_ Animals which feed on Plants, are directed by their 
 Smell, and accordingly make election of their Food: But Men (bessides 
 the _Smell_ and _Taste_) have, or should have, _Reason_, _Experience_, 
 and the Aids of _Natural Philosophy_ to be their Guides in this Matter. 
 We have heard _of Plants_, that (like the _Basilisk_) kill and infect by 
 [51]looking on them only; and some by the touch. The truth is, there  '  s 
 need of all the Senses to determine _Analogically_ concerning the 
 Vertues and Properties, even of the _Leaves_ alone of many _Edule 
 Plants_: The most eminent Principles of near the whole Tribe of _Sallet_ 
 Vegetables, inclining rather to _Acid_ and _Sowre_ than to any other 
 quality, especially, Salt, Sweet, or Luscious. There is therefore Skill 
 and Judgment requir  '  d, how to suit and mingle our _Sallet_-Ingredients, 
 so as may best agree with the Constitution of the (vulgarly reputed) 
 _Humors_ of those who either stand in need of, or affect these 
 Refreshments, and by so adjusting them, that as nothing should be 
 suffer  '  d to domineer, so should none of them lose their genuine Gust, 
 Savour, or Vertue. To this end, 
  
 The Cooler, and moderately refreshing, should be chosen to extinguish 
 Thirst, attemper the Blood, repress Vapours, _&c._
 
 The Hot, Dry, Aromatic, Cordial and friendly to the Brain, may be 
 qualify  '  d by the Cold and Moist: The Bitter and Stomachical, with the 
 _Sub-acid_ and gentler Herbs: The _Mordicant_ and pungent, and such as 
 repress or discuss Flatulency (revive the Spirits, and aid Concoction;) 
 with such as abate, and take off the keenness, mollify and reconcile the 
 more harsh and churlish: The mild and insipid, animated with _piquant_ 
 and brisk: The Astringent and Binders, with such as are Laxative and 
 Deobstruct: The over-sluggish, raw, and unactive, with those that are 
 Eupeptic, and promote Concoction: There are _Pectorals_ for the Breast 
 and Bowels. Those of middle Nature, according as they appear to be more 
 or less _Specific_; and as their Characters (tho  '   briefly) are describ  '  d 
 in our foregoing _Catalogue_: For notwithstanding it seem in general, 
 that raw _Sallets_ and _Herbs_ have experimentally been found to be the 
 most soveraign Diet in that _Endemial_ (and indeed with us, _Epidemical_ 
 and almost universal) Contagion the _Scorbute_, to which we of this 
 Nation, and most other _Ilanders_ are obnoxious; yet, since the 
 _Nasturtia_ are singly, and alone as it were, the most effectual, and 
 powerful Agents in conquering and expugning that cruel Enemy; it were 
 enough to give the _Sallet-Dresser_ direction how to choose, mingle, and
proportion his Ingredients; as well as to shew what Remedies there are 
 contain  '  d in our Magazine of _Sallet-Plants_ upon all Occasions, rightly 
 marshal  '  d and skilfully apply  '  d. So as (with our [52]sweet _Cowley_) 
  
  
 _If thro  '   the strong and beauteous Fence_ 
 _Of Temperance and Innocence,_ 
 _And wholsome Labours, and a quiet Mind,_ 
 _Diseases passage find;_ 
 _They must not think here to assail_ 
 _A Land unarm  '  d, or without Guard,_ 
 _They must fight for it, and dispute it hard,_ 
 _Before they can prevail;_ 
 _Scarce any Plant is used here,_ 
 _Which   '  gainst some Aile a Weapon does not bear_. 
  
  
 We have said how necessary it is, that in the Composure of a _Sallet_, 
 every Plant should come in to bear its part, without being over-power  '  d 
 by some Herb of a stronger Taste, so as to endanger the native _Sapor_
and vertue of the rest; but fall into their places, like the _Notes_ 
 in _Music_, in which there should be nothing harsh or grating: And 
 tho  '   admitting some _Discords_ (to distinguish and illustrate the rest) 
 striking in the more sprightly, and sometimes gentler Notes, reconcile 
 all Dissonancies, and melt them into an agreeable Composition. Thus the 
 Comical _Master-Cook_, introduc  '  d by _Damoxenus_, when asked [Greek: pôs 
 esin autois onmphonia]; _What Harmony there was in Meats_? The very 
 same (says he) that a _Diatessaron_, _Diapente_, and _Diapason_ have 
 one to another in a Consort of Music: And that there was as great care 
 requir  '  d, not to mingle [53]_Sapores minime consentientes_, jarring and 
 repugnant Tastes; looking upon him as a lamentable Ignorant, who should 
 be no better vers  '  d in _Democritus_. The whole Scene is very diverting, 
 as _Athenæus_ presents it; and to the same sense _Macrobius_, _Saturn. 
 lib._ I. _cap._ I. In short, the main Skill of the Artist lies in this: 
  
 _What choice to choose, for delicacy best;_ 
 _What Order so contriv  '  d, as not to mix_ 
 _Tastes not well join  '  d, inelegant, but bring_ 
 _Taste after Taste, upheld by kindliest change_. 
 
 
 As our [54]_Paradisian Bard_ introduces Eve, dressing of a _Sallet_ for 
 her _Angelical_ Guest. 
  
 Thus, by the discreet choice and mixture of the _Oxoleon_ (_Oyl_, 
 _Vinegar_, _Salt_, &c.) the Composition is perfect; so as neither the 
 _Prodigal_, _Niggard_, nor _Insipid_, should (according to the _Italian_ 
 Rule) prescribe in my Opinion; since _One_ may be too profuse, the 
 _Other_ [55]over-saving, and the _Third_ (like himself) give it no 
 Relish at all: It may be too _sharp_, if it exceed a grateful _Acid_; 
 too _Insulse_ and flat, if the Profusion be extream. From all which 
 it appears, that a Wise-Man is the proper Composer of an excellent 
 _Sallet_, and how many _Transcendences_ belong to an accomplish  '  d 
 _Sallet-Dresser_, so as to emerge an exact _Critic_ indeed, He should 
 be skill  '  d in the Degrees, Terms, and various _Species_ of Tastes, 
 according to the _Scheme_ set us down in the _Tables_ of the Learned 
 [56]Dr. _Grew_, to which I refer the Curious. 
  
  '  Tis moreover to be consider  '  d, that _Edule_ Plants are not in all their 
 Tastes and Vertues alike: For as Providence has made us to consist of
different Parts and Members, both Internal and External; so require they 
 different Juices to nourish and supply them: Wherefore the force and 
 activity of some Plants lie in the _Root_; and even the _Leaves_ of 
 some _Bitter-Roots_ are sweet, and _è contra_. Of others, in the _Stem_, 
 _Leaves_, _Buds_, _Flowers_, &c. Some exert their Vigour without 
 _Decoction_; others being a little press  '  d or contus  '  d; others again 
 _Raw_, and best in Consort; some alone, and _per se_ without any [Greek: 
 skenasia], Preparation, or Mixture at all. Care therefore must be taken 
 by the _Collector_, that what he gathers answer to these Qualities; and 
 that as near as he can, they consist (I speak of the _cruder Salleting_) 
 of the _Oluscula_, and _ex foliis pubescentibus_, or (as _Martial_ calls 
 them) _Prototomi rudes_, and very tenderest Parts _Gems_, young _Buds_, 
 and even first Rudiments of their several Plants; such as we sometimes 
 find in the _Craws_ of the _Wood-Culver_, _Stock-Dove_, _Partridge_, 
 _Pheasants_, and other Upland Fowl, where we have a natural _Sallet_, 
 pick  '  d, and almost dress  '  d to our hands. 
  
  
 I. Preparatory to the Dressing therefore, let your Herby Ingredients 
 be exquisitely cull  '  d, and cleans  '  d of all worm-eaten, slimy, canker  '  d,
dry, spotted, or any ways vitiated Leaves. And then that they be rather 
 discreetly sprinkl  '  d, than over-much sob  '  d with Spring-Water, especially 
 _Lettuce_, which Dr. [57]_Muffet_ thinks impairs their Vertue; but this, 
 I suppose he means of the _Cabbage_-kind, whose heads are sufficiently 
 protected by the outer Leaves which cover it. After washing, let them 
 remain a while in the _Cullender_, to drain the superfluous moisture: 
 And lastly, swing them altogether gently in a clean course Napkin; and 
 so they will be in perfect condition to receive the _Intinctus_ 
 following. 
  
  
 II. That the _Oyl_, an Ingredient so indispensibly and highly necessary, 
 as to have obtain  '  d the name of _Cibarium_ (and with us of _Sallet-Oyl_) 
 be very clean, not high-colour  '  d, nor yellow; but with an Eye rather of 
 a pallid _Olive_ green, without Smell, or the least touch of _rancid_, 
 or indeed of any other sensible Taste or Scent at all; but smooth, 
 light, and pleasant upon the Tongue; such as the genuine _Omphacine_, 
 and native _Luca Olives_ afford, fit to allay the tartness of _Vinegar_, 
 and other _Acids_, yet gently to warm and humectate where it passes. 
 Some who have an aversion to _Oyl_, substitute fresh _Butter_ in its
Medica_) which may be justly call  '  d _Infallible Specifics_, and upon 
 whose Performance we may as safely depend, as we may on such as 
 familiarly we use for a Crude _Herb-Sallet;_ discreetly chosen, mingl  '  d, 
 and dress  '  d accordingly: Not but that many of them may be improv  '  d, and 
 render  '  d better in Broths, and Decoctions, than in _Oyl_, _Vinegar_, 
 and other Liquids and Ingredients: But as this holds not in all, nay, 
 perhaps in few comparatively, (provided, as I said, the Choice, Mixture, 
 Constitution, and _Season_ rightly be understood) we stand up in Defence 
 and Vindication of our _Sallet_, against all Attacks and Opposers 
 whoever. 
  
 We have mentioned _Season_ and with the great _Hippocrates_, pronounce 
 them more proper for the Summer, than the Winter; and when those Parts 
 of Plants us  '  d in _Sallet_ are yet tender, delicate, and impregnated 
 with the Vertue of the Spring, to cool, refresh, and allay the Heat and 
 Drought of the Hot and _Bilious_, Young and over-_Sanguine_, Cold, 
 _Pituit_, and Melancholy; in a word, for Persons of all Ages, Humours, 
 and Constitutions whatsoever. 
  
 To this of the _Annual Seasons_, we add that of _Culture_ also, as of
very great Importance: And this is often discover  '  d in the taste and 
 consequently in the Goodness of such Plants and _Salleting_, as are 
 Rais  '  d and brought us fresh out of the Country, compar  '  d with those 
 which the Avarice of the _Gardiner_, or Luxury rather of the Age, tempts 
 them to force and _Resuscitate_ of the most desirable and delicious 
 Plants. 
  
 It is certain, says a [71]Learned Person, that about populous Cities, 
 where Grounds are over-forc  '  d for Fruit and early _Salleting_, nothing 
 is more unwholsom: Men in the Country look so much more healthy and 
 fresh; and commonly are longer liv  '  d than those who dwell in the Middle 
 and Skirts of vast and crowded Cities, inviron  '  d with rotten Dung, 
 loathsome and common Lay Stalls; whose noisome Steams, wafted by the 
 Wind, poison and infect the ambient Air and vital Spirits, with those 
 pernicious Exhalations, and Materials of which they make the _Hot Beds_ 
 for the raising those _Præcoces_ indeed, and forward Plants and Roots 
 for the wanton Palate; but which being corrupt in the Original, cannot 
 but produce malignant and ill Effects to those who feed upon them. And 
 the same was well observ  '  d by the _Editor_ of our famous _Roger Bacon  '  s_ 
 Treatise concerning the _Cure of Old Age_, and _Preservation of Youth_:
There being nothing so proper for _Sallet Herbs_ and other _Edule 
 Plants_, as the Genial and Natural Mould, impregnate, and enrich  '  d 
 with well-digested Compost (when requisite) without any Mixture of 
 Garbage, odious Carrion, and other filthy Ordure, not half consum  '  d and 
 ventilated and indeed reduc  '  d to the next Disposition of Earth it self, 
 as it should be; and that in Sweet, [72]Rising, Aery and moderately 
 Perflatile Grounds; where not only _Plants_ but _Men_ do last, and live 
 much longer. Nor doubt I, but that every body would prefer Corn, and 
 other Grain rais  '  d from _Marle_, _Chalk_, _Lime_, and other sweet Soil 
 and Amendments, before that which is produc  '  d from the _Dunghil_ only. 
 Beside, Experience shews, that the Rankness of _Dung_ is frequently the 
 Cause of Blasts and Smuttiness; as if the _Lord_ of the _Universe_, 
 by an Act of visible Providence would check us, to take heed of all 
 unnatural Sordidness and Mixtures. We sensibly find this Difference 
 in Cattle and their Pasture; but most powerfully in _Fowl_, from such 
 as are nourish  '  d with Corn, sweet and dry Food: And as of Vegetable 
 _Meats_, so of _Drinks_,   '  tis observ  '  d, that the same Vine, according 
 to the Soil, produces a _Wine_ twice as heady as in the same, and a 
 less forc  '  d Ground; and the like I believe of all other Fruit, not to 
 determine any thing of the _Peach_ said to be Poison in _Persia_;
because   '  tis a _Vulgar Error_. 
  
 Now, because among other things, nothing more betrays its unclean and 
 spurious Birth than what is so impatiently longed after as _Early 
 Asparagus_, &c. [73]Dr. _Lister_, (according to his communicative and 
 obliging Nature) has taught us how to raise such as our _Gardiners_ 
 cover with nasty Litter, during the Winter; by rather laying of 
 Clean and Sweet _Wheat-Straw_ upon the Beds, _super-seminating_ and 
 over-strowing them thick with the Powder of bruised _Oyster-Shells_, 
 &c. to produce that most tender and delicious _Sallet_. In the mean 
 while, if nothing will satisfie save what is rais  '  d _Ex tempore_, and 
 by Miracles of Art so long before the time; let them study (like the 
 _Adepti_) as did a very ingenious Gentleman whom I knew; That having 
 some Friends of his accidentally come to Dine with him, and wanting an 
 early Sallet, Before they sate down to Table, sowed _Lettuce_ and some 
 other Seeds in a certain Composition of Mould he had prepared; which 
 within the space of two Hours, being risen near two Inches high, 
 presented them with a delicate and tender _Sallet_; and this, without 
 making use of any nauseous or fulsome Mixture; but of Ingredients not 
 altogether so cheap perhaps. _Honoratus Faber_ (no mean _Philosopher_)
Vitellius _his Table, to which every Day_ 
 _All Courtiers did a constant Tribute pay,_ 
 _Could nothing more delicious afford_ 
 _Than Nature  '  s Liberality._ 
 _Help  '  d with a little Art and Industry,_ 
 _Allows the meanest Gard  '  ners Board,_ 
 _The Wanton Taste no Fish or Fowl can chuse,_ 
 _For which the Grape or Melon she would lose._ 
 _Tho  '   all th  '   Inhabitants of Sea and Air._ 
 _Be lifted in the Glutton  '  s Bill of Fare;_ 
 _Yet  still the_ Sallet, _and the_ Fruit _we see_ 
 _Plac  '  d the third Story high in all her Luxury_. 
  
  
 So the Sweet [110]_Poet_, whom I can never part with for his Love to 
 this delicious Toil, and the Honour he has done me. 
  
 Verily, the infinite Plenty and Abundance, with which the benign and 
 bountiful Author of Nature has stor  '  d the whole Terrestrial World, more 
 with _Plants_ and _Vegetables_ than with any other Provision whatsoever;
and the Variety not only equal, but by far exceeding the Pleasure 
 and Delight of Taste (above all the Art of the _Kitchen_, than ever 
 [111]_Apicius_ knew) seems loudly to call, and kindly invite all her 
 living Inhabitants (none excepted) who are of gentle Nature, and most 
 useful, to the same _Hospitable_ and Common-Board, which first she 
 furnish  '  d with _Plants_ and _Fruit_, as to their natural and genuine 
 Pasture; nay, and of the most wild, and savage too _ab origine_: As in 
 _Paradise_, where, as the _Evangelical_ [112]Prophet adumbrating the 
 future Glory of the _Catholick Church_, (of which that happy _Garden_ 
 was the _Antitype_) the _Wolf and the Lamb, the angry and furious Lion, 
 should eat Grass and Herbs together with the Ox_. But after all, _latet 
 anguis in herba_, there  '  s a _Snake_ in the Grass; Luxury, and Excess in 
 our most innocent Fruitions. There was a time indeed when the Garden 
 furnish  '  d Entertainments for the most Renown  '  d Heroes, virtuous and 
 excellent Persons; till the Blood-thirsty and Ambitious, over-running 
 the Nations, and by Murders and Rapine rifl  '  d the World, to transplant 
 its Luxury to its new Mistriss, _Rome_. Those whom heretofore [113]two 
 Acres of Land would have satisfied, and plentifully maintain  '  d; had 
 afterwards their very Kitchens almost as large as their first 
 Territories: Nor was that enough: Entire [114]_Forests_ and _Parks_,
That nobler Part, dull  '  d and depress  '  d we find. 
 Drowsie and unapt for Business, and other nobler Parts of Life. 
  
  
 Time was before Men in those golden Days: Their Spirits were brisk and 
 lively.

 With shorter, but much sweeter Sleep content, 
 Vigorous and fresh, about their Business went. 
  
  
 And Men had their Wits about them; their Appetites were natural, their 
 Sleep _molli sub arbore_, sound, sweet, and kindly: That excellent 
 Emperour _Tacitus_ being us  '  d to say of _Lettuce_, that he did _somnum 
 se mercari_ when he eat of them, and call  '  d it a sumptuous Feast, with 
 a _Sallet_ and a single _Pullet_, which was usually all the Flesh-Meat 
 that sober Prince eat of; whilst _Maximinus_ (a profess  '  d Enemy to

 the upper Skin, and pare away all the black spungy Bottom part; then 
 slice them in quarters, and cast them in Water a while to cleanse: Then 
 Boil them in fresh Water, and a little sweet Butter; (some boil them a 
 quarter of an hour first) and then taking them out, dry them in a Cloth, 
 pressing out the Water, and whilst hot, add the Butter; and then boiling 
 a full Hour (to exhaust the Malignity) shift them in another clean 
 Water, with Butter, as before till they become sufficiently tender. Then 
 being taken out, pour upon them as much strong Mutton (or other) Broth 
 as will cover them, with six Spoonfuls of White-Wine, twelve Cloves, as 
 many Pepper-Corns, four small young Onions, half an Handful of Persly 
 bound up with two or three Spriggs of Thyme, an_ Anchovy, _Oysters raw,

 being drained from them) in a third Part of White-Wine_ _and Butter, a

 with Cloves, Mace, Nutmeg_, Anchovies (_one is sufficient_) _Oysters_,

 Mutton-Gravy, rubbing the Dish gently with a Clove of Garlick, or some_ 
 Rocombo _Seeds in its stead. Some beat the Yolk of a fresh Egg with 
 Vinegar, and Butter, and a little Pepper_. 
  
 _In_ France _some (more compendiously being peel  '  d and prepared) cast
them into a Pipkin, where, with the Sweet Herbs, Spices, and an Onion 
 they stew them in their own Juice, without any other Water or Liquor at

 Butter, and so eat them_.
